## Edge Intent

- `edge.readme-drives-local-command-record` [change-driver, doc-only]: The selected local change can clarify README command flow while preserving source behavior and upstream boundaries.
- `edge.local-command-record-guards-upstream` [non-goal, upstream-boundary]: The local dogfood change must not become upstream approval, source-authority expansion, package-script change, or behavior change.

## Boundaries

- Mutates graph-source: False
- Applies patch: False
- Requires review before apply: True
- Maintainer intent claimed: False

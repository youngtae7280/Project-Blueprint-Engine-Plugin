## Project Blueprint Engine

If `.pbe/` exists, inspect it before planning work.

PBE is a Codex Plugin workflow and is evolving into a tree-based development control system. Do not revive the deprecated GUI/API-provider/SaaS direction unless the user explicitly changes the product direction.

PBE is optimized for safe, reviewable, staged project construction, not for speed.

After future PBE plugin changes, run the relevant validation, commit the finished work, and push to `origin/main` unless the user explicitly asks not to push.

## Tree Control Direction

The Product Tree is the source of product truth. Lower trees and execution artifacts must derive from it.

```text
Product Tree -> Project Tree -> Work Tree -> Test Tree
Cycle Tree -> Change Tree -> Impact Tree -> Evidence Tree -> Acceptance Tree
```

Compatibility terms stay valid during migration:

- `RPD`: Product Tree growth
- `WPD`: Project Tree and Work Tree derivation
- `VD`: Test Tree derivation
- `ACEP`: Cycle Contract and Node Execution Contract packaging
- `Revision`: Change Tree, Impact Tree, and Reopen protocol

Never implement work that cannot be traced to Product/Project/Work nodes. Never close work without Test/Evidence links. Never silently edit accepted blueprint scope during execution.

## Important Files

Prefer v2 files when present:

- `.pbe/tree/product-tree.json`
- `.pbe/tree/project-tree.json`
- `.pbe/tree/work-tree.json`
- `.pbe/tree/test-tree.json`
- `.pbe/execution/cycle-tree.json`
- `.pbe/execution/cycle-contract.md`
- `.pbe/execution/node-execution-contracts/`
- `.pbe/control/decision-queue.json`
- `.pbe/control/change-tree.json`
- `.pbe/control/impact-tree.json`
- `.pbe/control/acceptance-tree.json`
- `.pbe/evidence/evidence-tree.json`

Backward-compatible v1 views may also exist:

- `.pbe/blueprint/pbe-state.json`
- `.pbe/blueprint/source-of-truth-matrix.md`
- `.pbe/blueprint/pbe-invariants.md`
- `.pbe/blueprint/foundation-contract.md`
- `.pbe/blueprint/parallel-safety-contract.md`
- `.pbe/blueprint/requirement-tree.json`
- `.pbe/blueprint/ui-ux-confirmation.md`
- `.pbe/blueprint/work-design.json`
- `.pbe/blueprint/work-graph.json`
- `.pbe/blueprint/verification-design.json`
- `.pbe/blueprint/traceability-matrix.json`
- `.pbe/blueprint/execution-strategy.json`
- `.pbe/codex-execution-pack/04-traceability-matrix.json`
- `.pbe/codex-execution-pack/05-ui-ux-spec.json`
- `.pbe/codex-execution-pack/18-execution-strategy.md`
- `.pbe/codex-execution-pack/execution-manifest.json`

## Human Questioning Rule

Ask the user only when the answer changes product meaning, scope, UX, risk, acceptance criteria, verification strategy, or already implemented/verified/accepted work.

Use:

- `auto_derived` for obvious lower-tree nodes
- `assumed` for plausible low-risk defaults
- `needs_human_decision` for decisions that alter the tree
- `blocked` for decisions that must stop execution

## Execution Profiles

- `bypass`: typo, single-file edit, or clearly bounded small bug fix.
- `lite`: existing blueprint and small slice with limited risk.
- `full`: project construction, new feature, multi-module work, UI/UX, architecture runway, parallel work, or future-module impact.

Default to `full` for PBE project construction.

## Autoflow

Use `pbe-state.json.autoflow` to track:

- `profile`
- `state`
- `completedSteps`
- `currentGate`
- `nextStep`
- `lastFailure`

Automatic steps:

- `rpd`
- `wpd`
- `vd`
- `dependency_impact_audit`
- `plan_execution`
- `coverage_audit`
- `ux_audit`
- `generate_acep`
- `run_acep`

Human gates:

- `ui_ux_confirm`
- `implementation_scope`
- `architecture_runway`
- `review_result`
- `next_slice_decision`

At human gates, do not say only "waiting". Explain why PBE stopped, what risk exists, what the user should inspect, and give natural-language examples.

## Response Format

For PBE stage completion, human gate arrival, failures, and status requests, always use:

```text
[PBE 상태 보고]
```

first.

Use optional:

```text
[Codex 메모]
```

for explanation, recommendations, tradeoffs, and risk notes.

Rules:

- Keep `[PBE 상태 보고]` factual and structured.
- Put free-form reasoning only in `[Codex 메모]`.
- Always include `추천 답변` when a human gate is active.
- Do not use the status card for ordinary AI answers that do not report or change PBE workflow state.

Natural-language examples:

- "approve", "looks good", "continue" -> approve / continue
- "select scope: ..." -> select_scope
- "full scope" -> select_full_scope
- "defer ..." -> mark_deferred
- "foundation first", "interface only" -> mark_foundation
- "what is the dependency impact?" -> ask_dependency_impact
- "fix ...", "add ...", "change ..." -> revise
- "review ...", "what is risky?" -> ask
- "current status" -> status
- "stop" -> stop
- "complete current slice" -> complete_current_slice
- "start next slice" -> start_next_slice
- "complete project" -> complete_project

If an automatic step fails, set Autoflow to `BLOCKED`, record `lastFailure`, and do not continue downstream.

## Scope Classification

Every requirement, WorkGraph node, task, and coverage entry should distinguish:

- `selected`: implemented and verified in this slice
- `foundation`: structural work required now
- `deferred`: explicitly postponed
- `blocked`: cannot proceed safely
- `out_of_scope`: must not be changed

Deferred items are not current-slice failures. Missing selected or foundation items are failures.

## RPD Tree Walk

When running RPD:

1. Process one current node at a time.
2. Traverse breadth-first by default.
3. Ask exactly one open-ended question at a time.
4. Extract facts after each answer.
5. Ask before decomposing a node.
6. Ask before confirming a node.
7. Update `.pbe/blueprint/requirement-tree.json` after every confirmed decision.
8. Update `.pbe/blueprint/rpd-interview-log.md` after every interview turn.
9. Update Source of Truth Matrix links when requirements change.

RPD owns user intent, not coding task boundaries.

## WPD And WorkGraph

WPD must run Module Boundary Check internally. Do not create a separate Module Boundary Auditor skill.

WPD must not treat RPD nodes as direct Codex tasks. It must produce a module-aware WorkGraph with:

- `expectedFiles`
- `expectedSharedFiles`
- `forbiddenFiles`
- `unknownFileTouchRisk`
- `affectedDomains`
- dependency edges
- selected/foundation/deferred/blocked/out_of_scope classification

If `expectedFiles` is empty or unknown, the node is not parallel-safe.

## UI/UX Confirmation

For UI tasks:

1. Show a text wireframe, Markdown mockup, or prototype before implementation.
2. Get user confirmation before WPD, ACEP, or UI implementation proceeds.
3. Follow approved UI/UX direction.
4. Respect UI/UX non-scope.
5. Do not redesign confirmed flows unless a stop condition is reached.
6. Provide UI/UX evidence after implementation.
7. If screenshot is unavailable, write manual verification notes.

## Parallel Execution

Default policy:

```text
default = sequential
maxInitialParallelGroupSize = 2
maxMatureParallelGroupSize = 3
moreThanMaxRequiresHumanApproval = true
```

When executing ACEP:

1. Read `.pbe/codex-execution-pack/18-execution-strategy.md`.
2. Follow `execution-manifest.json` phases.
3. Run foundation tasks before feature tasks.
4. Only tasks explicitly assigned to a parallel group may run in parallel.
5. Do not parallelize unknown write sets.
6. Do not parallelize shared schemas, shared types, build config, auth, permissions, migrations, package configuration, or same-file changes.
7. Every parallel group must have an integration task.
8. Every parallel group must require integration evidence and integration pass.
9. If actual parallel execution is unavailable, execute parallel-capable tasks sequentially and still run the integration task.

## Cycle Execution

When v2 cycle files exist:

1. Read `.pbe/execution/cycle-tree.json` and `.pbe/execution/cycle-contract.md` before implementation.
2. Implement only included Work nodes.
3. Run only included Test nodes unless broader regression is explicitly required.
4. Do not touch excluded, deferred, or out-of-scope nodes.
5. If missing scope, design drift, new UX behavior, or technical impossibility is discovered, create or request a Change Node instead of silently coding it.
6. Attach evidence to `.pbe/evidence/evidence-tree.json` when available.
7. End as `submitted_for_review`, not accepted.

## ACEP Execution

When running ACEP:

1. Read `.pbe/codex-execution-pack/00-readme.md`.
2. Follow `.pbe/codex-execution-pack/execution-manifest.json`.
3. Read `.pbe/codex-execution-pack/04-traceability-matrix.json`.
4. Read `.pbe/codex-execution-pack/05-ui-ux-spec.json`.
5. Follow `.pbe/codex-execution-pack/10-codex-operating-loop.md`.
6. Execute selected and foundation scope only.
7. Do not implement deferred or out-of-scope behavior.
8. Run validation commands listed in `.pbe/codex-execution-pack/12-validation-commands.md`.
9. Complete `.pbe/codex-execution-pack/15-ui-ux-evidence-checklist.md` for UI work.
10. Complete `.pbe/codex-execution-pack/16-final-coverage-check.md` before final report.
11. End as `submitted_for_review`, not `accepted`.

## Result Review And Revision

Codex may report:

- implemented
- verified
- submitted_for_review
- revision_requested
- revision_in_progress
- revision_verified

Only the user can mark work as:

- accepted

If the user is dissatisfied:

1. Record feedback in `.pbe/review/user-feedback.md`.
2. Classify feedback in `.pbe/review/feedback-items.json`.
3. Map feedback to affected requirement/task/UI/verification items.
4. Create a revision pack under `.pbe/revisions/`.
5. Run revision tasks only within affected selected/foundation scope.
6. Re-run relevant regression checks.
7. Submit for review again.

When v2 change/impact files exist:

1. Record feedback as Change Tree input.
2. Map affected Product/Project/Work/Test/Evidence nodes.
3. Build or update Impact Tree.
4. Mark affected completed nodes as `stale`, `invalidated`, or `reopened` when needed.
5. Run only affected or reopened revision tasks.

After review approval, move to `WAITING_NEXT_SLICE_DECISION`. Do not mark `COMPLETED` unless the user explicitly completes the whole project.

## Stop Conditions

Stop and ask the user when work requires credentials, deployment, billing, destructive migration, out-of-scope changes, unresolved traceability/UI evidence gaps, UI implementation without confirmation, missing WorkGraph, missing Module Boundary Check, missing foundation approval, parallel group without integration task, forbidden shared-risk work inside a parallel group, revision outside affected scope, unclear feedback scope, or when the same validation failure repeats three times.

# PBE Routing Contract

Use this contract whenever `.pbe/` exists in the target repository or the user
mentions Project Blueprint Engine, PBE, `@project-blueprint-engine`, ACEP,
RPD, WPD, VD, traceability, dependency impact, implementation scope, or PBE
review.

## Routing Rules

1. Before implementation or modification work, read `.pbe/blueprint/pbe-state.json`.
2. If `autoflow.currentGate` is set, do not implement. Report the gate and ask for the user's decision.
3. If `autoflow.lastFailure` is set, do not continue downstream. Report `lastFailure` and repair options.
4. If `autoflow.nextStep` is deterministic, run that PBE step before ordinary coding.
5. If the user asks for ordinary explanation, usage help, status, or review without changing workflow state, answer normally and do not use a PBE status card unless reporting PBE state.
6. If the user asks for a bypass/lite/full decision, record the profile choice in `pbe-state.json.autoflow.profile`.
7. Do not run ACEP implementation unless the selected and foundation scope, execution strategy, coverage audit, and UX audit are ready.
8. Do not mark work `accepted`; only the user may do that through an explicit review reply.

## Deterministic Steps

```text
rpd
wpd
vd
dependency_impact_audit
plan_execution
coverage_audit
ux_audit
generate_acep
run_acep
```

## Human Gates

```text
ui_ux_confirm
implementation_scope
architecture_runway
review_result
next_slice_decision
```

## Bypass Rules

Use `bypass` only when the requested change is a typo, single-file edit, or
clearly bounded small bug fix with no UI, public API, persistence, schema,
parallel, dependency, security, deployment, or future-module impact.

If `.pbe/` exists and the request could affect selected, foundation, deferred,
or out-of-scope work, do not bypass without explaining the risk.

- Repeated verification misses without promotion/blocking:
- Selected requirements without tasks:
- Foundation items without tasks:
- Tasks without verification:
- Verification without evidence:
- Deferred items without reason:
- UI screens without evidence:

## Final Decision

The current slice can be submitted for review only if:

- no selected-scope coverage issue remains
- no required foundation issue remains
- no required validation is failing
- every included Work node has included Test coverage
- every included Test node has current Evidence Tree evidence or an explicit not-runnable explanation
- no required UI/UX state is missing without explanation
- no parity-critical surface claims parity without inventory and evidence
- no hardware-dependent feature claims certification without certification evidence
- no repeated verification miss is ignored without promotion, blocking, or human decision
- no stale, invalidated, or reopened item is being treated as accepted
- every parallel group has integration evidence and integration pass
- deferred and out-of-scope items were not implemented accidentally
- no stop condition remains unresolved

Whole-project completion requires explicit user approval at the next-slice decision gate.

# Graph Notes Demo

This tiny native PBE demo stores maintenance notes as graph-shaped records.

The project is intentionally small so PBE can demonstrate the same operation
chain used for larger projects:

graph-source -> instruction pack -> local change -> graph delta

When a note changes, keep its intent and status visible in the graph source or

## Building

On Windows CMake is usually used to create a Visual Studio solution file by running it inside the Developer Command Prompt for Visual Studio, for exact steps follow the official documentation from CMake and Microsoft and use the online search engine of your choice. The descriptions of the the options above still generally apply, although not all of them work on Windows.

#### Makefile

**NOTE:** This Method is deprecated. Use CMake if at all possible. Makefile support is limited to fixing bugs.

When changing parser, printer, or public API behavior, prefer the CMake test
suite with `-DENABLE_CJSON_TEST=On` so the full unit test surface is built and
run. The Makefile test path below is useful for simple checks, but it does not
replace the full CMake-based test suite.

# PBE Generate ACEP

Use this skill to generate `.pbe/codex-execution-pack/` from completed blueprint artifacts.

ACEP is not only a task-card bundle. It is a Codex execution contract that links requirements, tasks, verification, UI/UX expectations, evidence, and final coverage checks.

ACEP generation is deterministic in Autoflow. Run it automatically after
Coverage Audit and UX Audit pass.

Create as many task cards as the roadmap requires. Do not create fake work just to fill a count.

## Execution Contract Rules

Enforce these rules when generating ACEP:

- No requirement without task.
- No task without verification.
- No verification without evidence.
- No UI screen without state coverage.
- No final completion without coverage check.
- No UI implementation without UI/UX confirmation.
- No accepted status from Codex.
- No parallel execution plan without WPD WorkGraph.
- No parallel group without an integration task.
- No RPD requirement node copied directly into a Codex coding task.
- No forbidden shared-risk task inside a parallel group.
- No deferred requirement implemented by the current ACEP.
- No foundation task that implements deferred feature behavior.
- No slice completion recorded as whole-project completion.

If an item is deferred or out of scope, record the reason explicitly in the traceability matrix and final coverage check.

## Scope Contract

ACEP must separate:

- Selected Scope: implemented now.
- Foundation Scope: structural work required now for selected or future-safe implementation.
- Deferred Scope: recorded and protected, not implemented now.
- Blocked Scope: stop condition.
- Out-of-Scope: forbidden unless the user changes scope.

Only selected and foundation scope can become current ACEP implementation tasks.

## Traceability Matrix

Generate both:

```text
04-traceability-matrix.md
04-traceability-matrix.json
```

Each item links:

```text
Requirement Node -> Work Task -> Verification Item -> Evidence Required -> Coverage Status
```

Before final completion, Codex must inspect the traceability matrix and must not complete if:

- any requirement has no linked task
- any task has no linked verification
- any verification item has no required evidence
- any traceability item remains pending without explanation

## UI/UX Spec

Generate both:

```text
05-ui-ux-spec.md
05-ui-ux-spec.json
```

For every required screen or UI flow, include:

- screen name
- screen purpose
- primary user
- primary flow
- required UI elements
- empty, loading, success, validation error, server error, and permission states where applicable
- responsive priority
- accessibility expectations
- forbidden UX
- evidence required

## Task Cards

Every task card must include:

```text
## Requirement Links
## WorkGraph Links
## Verification Links
## UI/UX Links
## Evidence Required
## Coverage Update Required
```

UI task cards must also include:

```text
## Approved UI/UX Direction
## UI/UX Non-Scope
## UI/UX Evidence Required
## UI/UX Confirmation Reference
```

## Verification Plan

`09-verification-plan.md` must separate:

1. Automated Tests
2. Manual Checks
3. UI/UX Evidence Checks
4. Regression Checks
5. Acceptance Checks
6. Not Runnable / Environment-limited Checks

Every verification item must identify its linked requirement and task.

## Completion And Final Report

`13-completion-criteria.md` must require:

- task completion or explicit deferral/out_of_scope reason
- requirement coverage
- task-to-verification coverage
- evidence for every verification item
- validation pass or not-runnable explanation
- UI/UX evidence for required screens and states
- completed Final Coverage Check
- Result Review Pack creation
- delivery status `submitted_for_review`
- no unresolved stop condition
- user acceptance as a separate post-review decision

`17-final-report-template.md` must include requirement, task, verification, UI/UX confirmation, approved UI/UX implemented, traceability, evidence, files changed, deviations, known issues, delivery status, user review, revision history, stop conditions, and remaining manual review sections.

## Manifest Rules

`execution-manifest.json` must include:

- `autonomyLevel`
- `sourceBlueprintFiles`
- `contractFiles`
- ordered `tasks`
- validation strategy
- stop conditions
- final report path

Every task must include:

- `id`
- `file` or `taskCard`
- `title`
- `phase`
- `requirementIds`
- `verificationIds` or `verificationExplanation`
- `uiUxIds`
- `evidenceRequired`
- focused validation
- execution mode
- parallel group, when applicable
- conflict risk
- expected files
- expected shared files
- forbidden files
- dependencyResolved, writeSetKnown, rollbackPathAvailable when in a parallel group
- forbidden changes
- integration task, when applicable

Before generating ACEP, run or satisfy:

- `pbe-coverage-audit`
- `pbe-ux-audit`
- `pbe-plan-execution`

Do not generate ACEP if either audit has blocking issues.

## Autoflow

When ACEP generation succeeds:

- Set `pbe-state.json.autoflow.state` to `ACEP_GENERATED`.
- Add `generate_acep` to `autoflow.completedSteps`.
- Set `autoflow.nextStep` to `run_acep`.
- Continue automatically to ACEP Runner.

When ACEP generation fails:

- Set `autoflow.state` to `BLOCKED`.
- Record `autoflow.lastFailure.failedStep` as `generate_acep`.
- Do not continue to ACEP Runner.
- Show the Autoflow failure guidance.

## Execution Strategy

ACEP generation must include:

```text
18-execution-strategy.md
execution-manifest.json phases
parallelGroups
integrationTask for every parallel group
integrationEvidenceRequired
groupCannotCompleteWithoutIntegrationPass
Task Card Execution Strategy sections
```

Before generating ACEP, verify:

1. WPD WorkGraph exists in `work-graph.json` or `work-design.json`.
2. WPD Module Boundary Check was performed.
3. `pbe-plan-execution` produced `execution-strategy.json` and `execution-strategy.md`.
4. Every parallel group has an integration task.
5. Every parallel group requires integration evidence and integration pass before completion.
6. Forbidden shared-risk work is not placed in a parallel group.
7. Parallel group size follows policy or has human approval.
8. Final validation and review phases exist.

If any condition fails, report blocking issues instead of generating ACEP.

## Task Cards

Every task card must include:

```text
## Execution Strategy
```

The section must list:

- Mode
- Parallel Group
- Can Run In Parallel With
- Must Run After
- Must Run Before
- Conflict Risk
- Expected Files
- Expected Shared Files
- Forbidden Changes
- Integration Required
- Integration Task

Integration task cards must also include:

```text
## Parallel Group Integrated
## Tasks Integrated
## Conflict Checks
## Shared Contract Checks
## UI/UX Consistency Checks
## Validation Commands
## Evidence Required
## Remaining Risks
```

## Autonomy

Default autonomy level:

```text
autonomous_until_stop
```

Codex should continue through the task cards without asking the user unless a stop condition is reached.

## Stop Conditions

Stop and ask the user when work requires:

- credentials, secrets, tokens, or private accounts
- deployment, billing, or external infrastructure changes
- destructive migrations or irreversible data changes
- out-of-scope implementation
- legal, medical, financial, or security-sensitive decisions outside the repo context
- the same validation failure repeating three times
- missing requirements that make the task impossible to complete safely
- unresolved traceability or UI evidence gaps that block completion
- missing UI/UX confirmation for UI tasks
- missing WorkGraph or Module Boundary Check
- missing execution strategy from `pbe-plan-execution`
- parallel group without an integration task
- parallel group task requiring forbidden shared changes
- parallel group tasks likely to modify the same file

## Completion Report

Report with `[PBE 상태 보고]` first, following `templates/stage-completion-status-card-template.md`.

The state card must say whether ACEP generation succeeded and PBE is continuing automatically to ACEP Runner, or whether generation stopped with blockers.

Include:

- number of generated task cards
- traceability item count
- UI/UX screen count
- execution manifest path
- execution strategy path
- parallel group and integration task summary
- selected/foundation/deferred/out-of-scope scope summary
- validation command summary
- stop condition summary
- next automatic step: run ACEP
- review/revision workflow reminder
- user reply examples when blocked

Use `[Codex 메모]` only for short explanation of ACEP contract risk.

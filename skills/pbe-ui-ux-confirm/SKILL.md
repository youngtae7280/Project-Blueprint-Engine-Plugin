# PBE UI/UX Confirm

## CLI Transition Rule

Use PBE CLI transition commands for workflow state changes. Do not edit `.pbe/blueprint/pbe-state.json` directly. If a CLI command fails, follow the reported `suggestedFix` and `nextCommand`, and do not advance to the next stage while the failure remains. Codex must not replace explicit user acceptance.

Use this skill after RPD and before WPD when the project includes UI-facing screens, forms, flows, navigation, status messages, or visual states.

PBE remains a Codex Plugin workflow. Do not create a GUI app, API provider, or SaaS backend for confirmation.

This skill is a human gate in Autoflow. Stop here until the user approves, requests revision, asks a question, or stops.

## Purpose

Generate a UI/UX preview and get explicit user confirmation before implementation planning continues.

## Inputs

```text
.pbe/blueprint/requirement-tree.json
.pbe/blueprint/rpd-summary.md
.pbe/blueprint/source-of-truth-matrix.md
```

## Outputs

```text
.pbe/blueprint/ui-ux-preview.json
.pbe/blueprint/ui-ux-preview.md
.pbe/blueprint/ui-ux-confirmation.md
.pbe/blueprint/ui-ux-confirmation-log.md
.pbe/blueprint/visual-reference.json when selected UI work changes visual appearance
```

## Preview Levels

Use exactly one preview level for each screen or flow:

```text
text_wireframe
markdown_mockup
prototype
```

- `text_wireframe`: describes screen structure and flow in text.
- `markdown_mockup`: shows an ASCII or Markdown mockup.
- `prototype`: describes or creates a mock-data prototype with no real API integration.

Choose the lightest preview level that can support user confirmation. Ask the user only if the level is unclear.

## Confirmation Status

Use these statuses:

```text
not_required
preview_needed
preview_generated
revision_requested
confirmed
deferred
out_of_scope
blocked
```

## Rules

1. Show only one screen or flow preview at a time.
2. Do not mark a UI/UX item `confirmed` until the user explicitly confirms it.
3. If the user requests changes, mark it `revision_requested`, update the preview, and append to the confirmation log.
4. Do not proceed to WPD or ACEP while any required UI/UX item is not `confirmed`, `deferred`, `out_of_scope`, or `not_required`.
5. If the user defers or excludes a UI/UX item, record the reason.
6. Do not implement UI during confirmation.
7. If the user approves in natural language, update the confirmation artifact and run `pbe ui approve` so the CLI records `UI_UX_APPROVED`, clears the gate, and writes state history.
8. If the user requests revision, update the preview and stay at `WAITING_UI_UX_CONFIRM`.
9. If the user asks a question, answer from the preview and confirmation artifacts and stay at `WAITING_UI_UX_CONFIRM`.

## Visual Design Contract Handoff

UI/UX confirmation approves product flow, wording, controls, states, and exceptions. It does not by itself authorize visual redesign.

When selected UI work changes visual appearance, run or hand off to:

```text
pbe-visual-reference-intake
pbe-design-system-derive
```

Before WPD, ACEP, or UI implementation proceeds, selected visual UI work must have one of:

- `visual-reference.json` with `primarySource` set to `reference_screenshot`, `reference_app_or_site`, `existing_project_screen`, `interview_derived`, or `default_pbe_clean_theme`
- `visual-reference.json` with `primarySource: visual_quality_waived` and user-accepted waiver metadata
- `visual-reference.json` with `primarySource: not_required` only when no visual appearance changes are selected

If no visual source exists, stop at the visual source gate and offer all six choices. Do not ask only for a screenshot.

The six choices are:

1. Reference screenshot.
2. Reference app or site.
3. Existing project screen.
4. Short visual interview.
5. Default PBE Clean Theme.
6. Visual quality waiver for this slice.

## Friendly Gate Guidance

Use friendly guidance instead of internal command-only instructions:

```text
UI/UX confirmation is needed.

Please review:
- core user flow
- screen structure
- buttons, labels, and terms
- empty, loading, success, error, and permission states
- exception handling

If this looks okay, say so naturally.

Examples:
"approve"
"looks good, continue"
"this is okay"

If changes are needed, describe what should change.

Examples:
"add a retry button when printer connection fails"
"the card eject failure screen seems missing"
"show initial setup before the main flow"

If you are unsure, ask for review help.

Examples:
"what is the riskiest part of this UX?"
"check whether an exception case is missing"
"find anything awkward from a user perspective"

After approval, PBE continues automatically:
WPD -> VD -> Dependency Impact Audit -> Implementation Scope Gate
```

Also list the preview and confirmation file paths.

Use `[PBE 상태 보고]` first, following `templates/ui-ux-gate-message-template.md`. If additional explanation is useful, put it under `[Codex 메모]`.

## Approval Mapping

Treat these user responses as approval:

```text
approve
looks good
continue
this is okay
```

After approval, automatically run:

```text
WPD -> VD -> Dependency Impact Audit -> Implementation Scope Gate
```

If any downstream step fails, stop and show the failure response from `templates/autoflow-failure-message-template.md`.

## Completion Report

Report with `[PBE 상태 보고]` first:

- preview file paths
- confirmed screens/flows
- visual source status and whether a Visual Design Contract is required
- deferred or out_of_scope screens/flows
- blocked items
- whether WPD may proceed
- workflow state
- next automatic downstream steps
- user reply examples
- recommended reply

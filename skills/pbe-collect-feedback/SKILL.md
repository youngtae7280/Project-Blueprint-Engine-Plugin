# PBE Collect Feedback

Use this skill when the user says the result is not acceptable, asks for changes, or gives review feedback after `submitted_for_review`.

In Autoflow, this skill runs automatically when the user gives a revision request at the Review Result gate.

When feedback changes product meaning, scope, UI/UX behavior, acceptance criteria, verification strategy, or previously completed work, create or update Change Tree and Impact Tree before coding. Then run:

```bash
pbe trace check
pbe gate code-start
```

Do not silently modify completed scope without a Change node and Impact record.

## Purpose

Turn user feedback into structured feedback items and Change Tree input that can drive bounded Impact/Reopen analysis and Revision Pack creation.

Feedback is not a license to reinterpret the whole project. It must be mapped to affected tree nodes or clarified before revision work starts.

Feedback that is ambiguous, especially quality language such as "cleaner", "nicer", "faster", "more stable", or "깔끔하게", must enter Ambiguity Gate and Revision RPD. Do not rerun full RPD unless the user explicitly changes the whole product direction.

## Inputs

Prefer v2 files when present:

```text
.pbe/tree/product-tree.json
.pbe/tree/project-tree.json
.pbe/tree/work-tree.json
.pbe/tree/test-tree.json
.pbe/execution/cycle-tree.json
.pbe/control/change-tree.json
.pbe/control/impact-tree.json
.pbe/control/acceptance-tree.json
.pbe/control/legacy-control-inventory.json
.pbe/control/surface-completion-ledger.json
.pbe/control/hardware-readiness-ledger.json
.pbe/control/visual-verification-profile.json
.pbe/control/verification-miss-log.json
.pbe/evidence/evidence-tree.json
```

Also read review and compatibility artifacts:

```text
.pbe/review/codex-final-report.md
.pbe/review/result-summary.md
.pbe/review/user-feedback.md
.pbe/review/feedback-items.json
.pbe/codex-execution-pack/execution-manifest.json
.pbe/codex-execution-pack/04-traceability-matrix.json
.pbe/codex-execution-pack/05-ui-ux-spec.json
```

## Outputs

```text
.pbe/review/user-feedback.md
.pbe/review/feedback-items.json
.pbe/control/change-tree.json
.pbe/control/verification-miss-log.json
```

## Feedback Types

Use one of:

```text
bug
missing_requirement
misinterpreted_requirement
ux_mismatch
visual_mismatch
scope_gap
performance_issue
content_copy_issue
accessibility_issue
other
```

## Mapping Rules

Each feedback item should map to affected artifacts:

- `affectedProductNodeIds`
- `affectedProjectNodeIds`
- `affectedWorkNodeIds`
- `affectedTestNodeIds`
- `affectedEvidenceNodeIds`
- `affectedCycleIds`
- `affectedRequirementIds`
- `affectedTaskIds`
- `affectedUiUxIds`
- `affectedVerificationIds`
- `changeNodeIds`
- related parity/completion artifact IDs, when present
- `verificationMissIds`, when the feedback reveals a missed validation dimension

If mapping is impossible, provide an explanation and ask at most one concise clarification question.

Do not reinterpret the entire project. Keep feedback scoped to the affected items.

For each feedback item, record:

- `ambiguity.status`
- missing ambiguity slots
- abstract quality terms
- whether `revisionRpd.required` is true
- acceptance criteria IDs added, modified, or invalidated

## Surface Re-Audit And Miss Promotion

When feedback mentions visual mismatch, alignment, clipping, popup mismatch, missing visible controls, legacy parity, hardware readiness, or a repeated failure pattern:

1. Decide whether the feedback should trigger surface re-audit for the related surface.
2. Map the feedback to `surface-completion-ledger.json`, `legacy-control-inventory.json`, `visual-verification-profile.json`, or `hardware-readiness-ledger.json` entries when they exist.
3. Add or update `.pbe/control/verification-miss-log.json` with `whyPreviousVerificationMissedThis`.
4. If the same miss type has occurred at least twice, mark promotion as `pending`, `promoted`, or `blocked`; do not leave the repeated miss as an ordinary local patch.
5. Do not automatically expand implementation scope. If the re-audit discovers new Product meaning, UX, acceptance, verification, or selected scope, create or request a Change Node.

## Change Node Classification

Create or update a Change Tree entry when feedback changes any of:

- product meaning
- selected/deferred/out-of-scope scope
- UI/UX flow, state, wording, or acceptance meaning
- risk profile
- acceptance criteria
- verification strategy
- already implemented, verified, evidenced, submitted, or accepted work

If the feedback changes acceptance criteria or has ambiguous product meaning, set `requiresRevisionRpd: true` on the Change Node and do not create implementation tasks until the affected criteria are resolved.

When feedback modifies, adds, or invalidates criteria, record `criteriaChanges` on the Feedback Item and `criteriaDelta` plus `affectedAcceptanceCriteriaIds` on the Change Node.

Use Change Tree types:

```text
missing_requirement
design_correction
implementation_constraint
test_gap
feedback
scope_change
risk_discovery
```

Set Change Tree status:

- `proposed` when Codex can map the issue but user approval may be needed later.
- `needs_human_decision` when the feedback has multiple product/scope meanings.
- `approved` only when the user explicitly approved the change direction.
- `blocked` when mapping cannot proceed safely.

## Ask User Only When

Ask one concise clarification question when feedback meaning is ambiguous or options change Product Tree scope, UX, acceptance, verification, or accepted work.

Do not ask when the feedback maps cleanly to an existing affected selected/foundation node and the desired outcome is clear.

## Autoflow

When feedback is mapped clearly:

- Set `pbe-state.json.autoflow.lastUserAction` to `revise`.
- Keep `autoflow.state` at `WAITING_REVIEW_RESULT` while revision is being prepared, or set `deliveryStatus` to `revision_requested`.
- Add or update downstream retry steps:
  - `create_revision_pack`
  - `run_revision`
  - `review_result`
- Continue automatically to `pbe-create-revision-pack`.

When mapping is unclear:

- Do not create revision tasks yet.
- Ask one concise clarification question.
- Keep the user at the Review Result gate.

## Completion Report

Report with `[PBE 상태 보고]` first, following `templates/stage-completion-status-card-template.md`.

The state card must say whether feedback mapping is clear enough to continue automatically to Impact/Reopen and Revision Pack creation, or whether a clarification question is required.

Include:

- feedback item count
- affected Product/Project/Work/Test/Evidence/Cycle nodes
- Change Tree entries created or updated
- verification miss entries created or updated
- surface re-audit trigger decision, when relevant
- affected compatibility requirement/task/UI/verification IDs
- clarification questions if needed
- next step: create revision pack, automatically when scope is clear
- recommended reply when clarification is needed

Use `[Codex 메모]` only for short mapping rationale.

# PBE Run ACEP

Use this skill to execute an existing Autonomous Codex Execution Pack.

ACEP execution is contract execution, not only task execution. Codex must keep Product, Project, Work, Test, requirement, task, verification, UI/UX, evidence, and coverage links intact.

In PBE v2, ACEP Runner executes only the selected Cycle Contract and its Node Execution Contracts. It must not execute excluded, deferred, blocked, or out-of-scope nodes unless the user changes scope through an approved gate.

ACEP Runner is deterministic in Autoflow. Run it automatically after ACEP generation succeeds, then stop at the Review Result gate.

Run ACEP only for selected scope and required foundation scope. Deferred and out-of-scope items are protected scope and must not be implemented unless the user changes the implementation scope through a gate.

15. Do not move to the next phase until the integration task passes required validation or records a stop condition.
16. Execute selected and foundation tasks only.
17. Execute only included Work nodes and included Test nodes unless a broader regression check is explicitly included in the Cycle Contract.
18. Treat deferred, excluded, blocked, and out-of-scope task requests as stop conditions unless scope was approved.
19. Respect scope, non-scope, Cycle Contract, Node Execution Contract, and Execution Strategy in every task.
20. Track evidence after every task.
21. Attach or update evidence in `.pbe/evidence/evidence-tree.json` when evidence can be represented.
22. Run focused validation after each task when feasible.
23. If UI changed, update or complete UI/UX evidence checklist notes.
24. Fix failures and revalidate.
25. Run broader validation at phase or pack completion.
26. When parity/completeness profile artifacts exist, update surface completion, visual/runtime verification, hardware readiness, and verification miss evidence before final coverage.
27. Record any uninspected dialog, subdialog, control, event handler, hardware action, or workflow state in the final report `Not Checked` section and in the relevant control artifact.
28. Complete `16-final-coverage-check.md`.
29. Check `13-completion-criteria.md`.
30. Write the final report using `17-final-report-template.md` only when technical completion criteria are satisfied.
31. Do not mark the result `accepted` or `accepted_done`.
32. End as `submitted_for_review` and run or recommend `pbe-review-result`.
33. Update `pbe-state.json.autoflow.state` to `ACEP_RUN_DONE`.
34. Add `run_acep` to `autoflow.completedSteps`.
35. Set `autoflow.nextStep` to `review_result`.
36. Continue automatically to Result Review gate.

## Per-Task Loop

For each task:

1. Read the task card.
2. Read the linked Node Execution Contract when present.
3. Inspect its `## Cycle Scope` and `## Execution Strategy` sections.
4. Inspect linked Product, Project, Work, and Test node IDs.
5. Inspect linked requirement IDs.
6. Inspect linked verification IDs.
7. Inspect linked UI/UX IDs if any.
8. Inspect approved UI/UX direction and non-scope for UI tasks.
9. Confirm the task is inside the active Cycle Slice.
10. Confirm the task is being run in the correct phase and mode.
11. Confirm the task is selected or foundation scope.
12. If the task is foundation scope, ensure it does not implement deferred feature behavior.
13. If the task is in a parallel group, verify it does not require forbidden changes before starting.
14. Implement the smallest coherent change.
15. Add or update tests.
16. Run focused validation.
17. Capture evidence:
    - changed files
    - test files
    - command output
    - validation summary
    - UI manual verification note if UI changed
    - screenshot path if available
    - legacy inventory comparison result when parity is claimed
    - visual/runtime verification result when required
    - hardware readiness or certification result when relevant
18. Update traceability, evidence, or coverage notes.
19. Move to the next task only when task acceptance criteria and evidence requirements are satisfied.

## Scope Enforcement

Allowed:

- implementation details inside included Work nodes
- included Test nodes and explicitly required regression checks
- selected and foundation files named by the task card or NEC

Requires Change Node:

- new product behavior
- new UI flow
- API contract change not included in the Cycle Contract
- permission/security change
- acceptance criterion change
- verification strategy change
- parity/completeness claim change
- hardware certification claim change
- changes to excluded/deferred/blocked/out-of-scope nodes
- implementation that makes previously verified evidence stale

When a Change Node is required, record or request it in `.pbe/control/change-tree.json`, set Autoflow to `BLOCKED` if approval is required, and do not silently continue.

## Phase And Parallel Group Rules

When `execution-manifest.json` contains `phases`, follow them:

1. Foundation phase is sequential.
2. Independent feature phase may contain parallel groups.
3. Each parallel group must finish all group tasks before its integration task.
4. Integration phase is sequential.
5. Final validation and review phases are sequential.

For a parallel phase:

1. Read each `parallelGroups[]` entry.
2. Confirm every `requiredCompletedBeforeStart` task is complete.
3. Confirm tasks do not overlap expected files or require forbidden shared changes.
4. Execute group tasks in parallel only if the Codex environment supports it.
5. Otherwise execute them sequentially as parallel-capable tasks.
6. Run the `integrationTask`.
7. Stop if the integration task cannot resolve conflicts safely.

## Partial Testing

Selected Test nodes may pass, fail, be manual_required, skipped, deferred, or blocked. Product nodes receive only partial satisfaction when Test coverage is partial.

Do not mark Product branches `accepted_done`. Only the user may close Product branches through review/acceptance.

## No-Question Rule

Do not ask the user during ACEP execution unless a stop condition is reached.

## Stop Conditions

Stop when work requires:

- credentials or secrets
- deployment or billing changes
- destructive migration
- out-of-scope behavior
- deferred-scope implementation
- excluded Cycle Slice node changes
- foundation work expanding into deferred feature behavior
- a decision that changes product intent
- a repeated validation failure after three attempts
- unavailable dependency or environment that blocks meaningful progress
- unresolved traceability gap that blocks completion
- missing UI/UX evidence for a required UI screen or state
- command-mapped dialog, popup, subdialog, or workflow that lacks child surface inventory, child Test coverage, or evidence
- required legacy control or event handler that remains missing, unverified, or not checked
- hardware-gated surface that lacks mock-backed, fake-result, UI-automation, or explicit blocking manual-not-verified evidence
- a not-checked item that blocks technical stability, parity review, or product acceptance
- implementation would conflict with confirmed UI/UX direction
- missing Cycle Contract or missing Node Execution Contract for a selected Work node
- a parallel group task requires shared schema, shared type, build config, auth, permission, migration, package configuration, deployment, billing, secret handling, or another forbidden change
- two tasks in the same parallel group need to modify the same file
- a parallel group has no integration task
- an integration task cannot safely resolve conflicts or shared contract issues

## Final Coverage Gate

Before final completion:

1. Read the active Cycle Contract.
2. Read the traceability matrix.
3. Read the UI/UX evidence checklist.
4. Complete the final coverage check.
5. Verify included Product nodes have linked Work nodes or explicit explanation.
6. Verify included Work nodes have Test nodes or explicit not-runnable explanation.
7. Verify there are no verification items without evidence or not-runnable explanation.
8. Verify no required UI state is missing without explanation.
9. Verify any active surface completion ledger does not claim parity without inventory and evidence.
10. Verify commands that open dialogs have child surface inventory and workflow/dialog evidence.
11. Verify required legacy controls and event handlers are matched or explicitly deferred/blocked/out of scope.
12. Verify hardware-gated surfaces have substitute evidence or blocking `manual_not_verified` entries.
13. Verify the final report lists every not-checked dialog, control, event handler, hardware action, and workflow state.
14. Verify any hardware-certified feature has certification evidence.
15. Verify any required visual profile checks passed or have explicit not-runnable evidence/reason.
16. Verify no unresolved stop condition remains.
17. Verify excluded nodes were not changed.

If coverage issues remain, continue working or record a stop condition. Do not write the final report first.

## Autoflow Failure

If ACEP execution cannot continue:

- Set `autoflow.state` to `BLOCKED`.
- Record `autoflow.lastFailure.failedStep` as `run_acep`.
- Record downstream steps that would be retried after repair.
- Do not continue to Result Review.
- Show the Autoflow failure guidance.

## Delivery Status

Codex may set or report:

```text
implemented
verified
submitted_for_review
```

Codex must not set:

```text
accepted
accepted_done
```

Only the user can accept the result. If the user is dissatisfied, continue with `pbe-collect-feedback`, `pbe-create-revision-pack`, and `pbe-run-revision`.

## Completion Report

When complete, report with `[PBE 상태 보고]` first, following `templates/stage-completion-status-card-template.md`.

The state card must say that ACEP execution ended as `submitted_for_review` and PBE is stopping at the Review Result gate. Include user reply examples for approval, revision, question, and stop.

Include:

- active cycle ID
- included Work/Test nodes executed
- excluded/deferred/out-of-scope nodes protected
- tasks completed
- selected/foundation tasks completed
- files changed
- validations run
- skipped validations and reasons
- evidence tree update result
- traceability matrix result
- UI/UX evidence result
- surface completion and parity result, when active
- dialog/subdialog controls and event-handler result, when active
- Not Checked section summary
- hardware readiness result, when active
- verification miss promotion result, when active
- final coverage check result
- execution strategy result
- parallel group and integration task result
- delivery status: `submitted_for_review`
- unresolved risks
- final report path
- current gate: review_result
- recommended reply for the user

Use `[Codex 메모]` only for short explanation of remaining risk or validation interpretation.

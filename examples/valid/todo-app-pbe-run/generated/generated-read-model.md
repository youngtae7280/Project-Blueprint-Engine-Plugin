# Generated Read-Model Evidence

Status: generated-present / evidence-only / source-authority-unchanged

## Run Identity

- Generated at: 2026-06-25T08:07:56.186Z
- Command identity: `pbe graph read-model generate --slice examples/valid/todo-app-pbe-run`
- Source commit: 3bfca70
- Source slice: `examples/valid/todo-app-pbe-run`

## Boundary

Canonical .pbe tree/control/execution/evidence artifacts remain current operational source for this structure-only
fixture.

Generated structure-only output is reviewable Evidence only. It does not change source authority, create a pilot marker,
require parity, introduce CI enforcement, retire .pbe artifacts, or approve promotion.

## Node / Edge / Tag Summary

- Nodes: 22
- Edges: 38
- Node kinds: requirement,code,task,check,evidence,decision,change,finding,document,log,view-instance
- Edge types: targets,requires,satisfies,touches,verifies,evidences,approves,preserves,reports-on,derives-view
- Allowed view-scoped tags: target, context, candidate, guard, required, stale, blocked, output

View membership is separated from `viewScopedTags` through `includedInViewIds` and `coreViewCoverage`.

## Retained Warnings

- RW-STRUCTURE-ONLY: structure-only-limitation - This profile validates canonical .pbe structure only; no manual parity
  artifact, pilot marker, CI-backed Evidence, or source-authority pilot is required or claimed.
- RW-NO-RUNTIME-FIXTURE: accepted-structure-only-limitation - The fixture contains attached test-output Evidence but no
  runnable app/runtime fixture is required for structure-only validation.

## Compatibility Warning Carry-Forward

# Read-Model Validation Report

Status: validation-pass

Evidence level: validator-backed

## Run Identity

- Validated at: 2026-06-29T08:05:12.444Z
- Command identity: `pbe graph read-model validate --slice examples/valid/todo-app-pbe-run`
- Source commit: 536a89b
- Source slice: `examples/valid/todo-app-pbe-run`
- Profile id: `todo-app-pbe-run-structure-only`
- Source layout: canonical-pbe
- Policy level: structure-only
- Scope level: scoped-slice-validation

## Boundary

Validator-backed Evidence checks structure-only generated read-model outputs for this canonical .pbe fixture. It does
not change source authority.

Structure-only validation pass is Evidence only. It does not promote Maintainability Graph, create a source-authority
pilot, require parity, introduce CI enforcement, retire .pbe artifacts, or replace user approval.

## Per-Slice Independence Contract

- Report unit: per-slice-validation-report
- Expected nodes: 22
- Expected edges: 38
- Expected validation checks: 16
- Generated read-model: examples/valid/todo-app-pbe-run/generated/generated-read-model.json
- Parity requirement: not-required (not-required-for-structure-only)
- Pilot marker requirement: not-required (not-required-for-structure-only)
- Runtime fixture requirement: attached-evidence-only
- Fallback/reference count: 15
- Missing fallback/reference count: 0

Validation uses the target slice profile, generated artifacts, and declared source inputs only. It must not depend on
another slice generated directory, manual parity artifact, pilot marker, or runtime fixture unless that artifact is
declared by this profile.

## Retained Warnings

- RW-STRUCTURE-ONLY: structure-only-limitation - This profile validates canonical .pbe structure only; no manual parity
  artifact, pilot marker, CI-backed Evidence, or source-authority pilot is required or claimed.
- RW-NO-RUNTIME-FIXTURE: accepted-structure-only-limitation - The fixture contains attached test-output Evidence but no
  runnable app/runtime fixture is required for structure-only validation.

## Recommended Next Decision Surface

- Continue active observation
- Design CI workflow integration before broader enforcement
- Apply scoped validator to another explicitly approved slice
- Perform public-doc cleanup
- Prepare broader Graph-source promotion review
- Rollback or defer scoped pilot

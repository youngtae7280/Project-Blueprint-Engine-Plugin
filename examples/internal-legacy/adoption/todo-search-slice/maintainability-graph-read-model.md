# Maintainability Graph Read-Model Parity Artifact

Status: manual Node/Edge/Tag parity artifact

This artifact refreshes the `Todo Search Adoption + Product Meaning Feedback` read-model parity output under
[graph-node-edge-tag-policy.md](../../../docs/concept/graph-node-edge-tag-policy.md). It shows that the selected-slice
tree-native artifacts can be interpreted as durable Graph nodes, durable semantic edges, and view-scoped tags for 7
Core Views.

It is not Graph-source promotion. It does not change source authority, does not mark tree-native artifacts as
projections, and does not implement a generated graph builder, CLI command, schema, runtime model, validator, migration,
or rollback command.

Tree-native selected-slice artifacts remain the current operational source.

## What Changed In This Refresh

The previous manual parity artifact used tree-parity-oriented fields such as `graphType` and relationship labels such
as `realizedByWork`, `verifiedBy`, and `evidencedBy`.

This refresh keeps those legacy meanings traceable but adds the new Graph-first responsibility split:

- durable targets use `nodeKind`
- durable semantic relationships use `edgeType`
- view membership uses `includedInViewIds`
- per-view role assignments use `viewRoles`
- flattened view-local role tags use `viewScopedTags`
- confidence and freshness/status are separate fields
- 7 Core View coverage is represented through `coreViewCoverage` and `view-instance-manifest.json`

`viewScopedTags` contains only the eight allowed role tags: `target`, `context`, `candidate`, `guard`, `required`,
`stale`, `blocked`, and `output`. Core View ids such as `behavior-view` or `scope-execution-view` are membership ids,
not tags, and are stored in `includedInViewIds` / `viewRoles` instead.

## Source Inputs

The read model is derived manually from reviewable sources:

- `product-tree.json`
- `project-tree.json`
- `work-tree.json`
- `test-tree.json`
- `evidence-tree.json`
- `acceptance-tree.json`
- `change-tree.json`
- `impact-tree.json`
- `product-patch-tree.json`
- `cycle-contract.md`
- `node-execution-contracts/wt-search-001.md`
- `runtime-evidence.md`
- `approval-brief.md`
- `evidence-exceptions.md`
- `examples/internal-legacy/adoption/compatibility-mismatch-slice/compatibility-control-node.md`
- `docs/concept/graph-node-edge-tag-policy.md`
- `docs/concept/view-tree-pack.md`

## View-Scoped Tag Summary

View-scoped tags are temporary roles inside a View Instance only.

This artifact separates view membership from view role tags:

- `includedInViewIds` records which Core View instances include the node.
- `viewRoles` records the node's allowed role tags per Core View id.
- `viewScopedTags` is a flat role-tag summary and never contains Core View ids.

Allowed tags used here:

```text
target, context, candidate, guard, required, stale, blocked, output
```

Examples:

- `BEH-NON-SCOPE-GUARD` is tagged `guard` inside Behavior and Scope / Execution Views.
- `TT-SEARCH-004` is tagged `required` inside Verification View.
- `EV-SEARCH-NOTE-TEST` is tagged `output` inside Evidence / Acceptance View.
- `FIND-GENERATED-BUILDER-MISSING` is tagged `blocked` inside Scope / Execution View for full promotion/repeatability.

The artifact does not use tags such as `implements`, `verifies`, `evidences`, `code.target`, or `test.required`.

## 7 Core View Coverage Matrix

| Core View                  | Coverage | Key node kinds                                                 | Key edge types                                      | Retained boundary                                                             |
| -------------------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Intent View                | present  | `task`, `requirement`, `decision`, `document`                  | `targets`, `requires`, `approves`                   | Promotion decision remains user-controlled.                                   |
| Behavior View              | present  | `requirement`, `behavior`, `code`, `data`                      | `implements`, `satisfies`, `reads`, `takes-input`   | Fixture behavior is representative, not full app proof.                       |
| Structure View             | present  | `code`, `data`, `task`                                         | `touches`, `reads`, `targets`                       | Project/code anchors remain manual demo-support boundaries.                   |
| Scope / Execution View     | present  | `task`, `document`, `behavior`, `check`, `evidence`, `finding` | `requires`, `preserves`, `reports-on`               | Contracts expose selected/non-scope boundaries and generated-builder gap.     |
| Impact View                | present  | `decision`, `change`, `finding`, `evidence`, `task`            | `touches`, `invalidates`, `preserves`, `reports-on` | PP-001 stale/reopen and compatibility cleanup caveats remain visible.         |
| Verification View          | present  | `behavior`, `check`, `evidence`, `code`                        | `verifies`, `evidences`                             | UI visual evidence is partial even though runtime behavior evidence is fresh. |
| Evidence / Acceptance View | present  | `evidence`, `decision`, `document`, `finding`                  | `evidences`, `approves`, `reports-on`, `requires`   | Renewed Acceptance is recorded; limited pilot promotion approval is pending.  |

## Confidence / Freshness Split

The artifact separates confidence from freshness/status.

Examples:

- `EV-SEARCH-NOTE-TEST` has `confidence: tool-confirmed` and `freshnessStatus: fresh`.
- `AT-ROOT` has `confidence: user-confirmed` and `freshnessStatus: fresh`.
- `EV-SEARCH-TEST` has `confidence: tool-confirmed` and `freshnessStatus: stale`.
- `EV-SEARCH-REVIEW` has `confidence: inferred` and `freshnessStatus: stale`.

`stale` is never used as a confidence value.

## Retained Warnings

| Warning                                                | Classification after refresh                                            |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Bounded fixture Evidence, not full Todo app runtime    | acceptable warning for limited pilot                                    |
| UI screenshot/manual visual evidence remains partial   | acceptable warning for limited pilot                                    |
| Generated graph builder or CLI-backed output is absent | later implementation requirement for full promotion or CI repeatability |
| Execution pack task-card public-doc cleanup deferred   | deferred cleanup                                                        |

## Remaining Gaps

- No generated graph builder or CLI-backed read-model output exists.
- UI screenshot/manual visual evidence remains partial.
- Execution pack task-card public-doc cleanup remains deferred.
- Actual scoped limited pilot transition execution remains a separate task.

## Limited Pilot Readiness Judgment

```text
Node/Edge/Tag parity: demonstrated for limited pilot review with retained warnings
Limited pilot package: user approved bounded limited pilot option; transition record prepared
Full promotion: not ready without generated builder / broader parity decision
```

This means the previous Graph-first baseline refresh blocker is resolved for limited pilot review, and the bounded Todo
Search limited pilot option has been approved into `docs/concept/limited-pilot-transition-record.md`. It does not make
full promotion ready.

## Why This Is Not Graph-Source Promotion

- The source inputs remain tree-native artifacts.
- This file is a read/alignment output only.
- No source model is changed.
- No tree-native artifact is marked as projection.
- No generated graph builder, CLI, schema, runtime model, validator, migration, or rollback command is implemented.
- User promotion approval is still required before any source authority change.

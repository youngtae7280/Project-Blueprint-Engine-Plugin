# Todo Search Compatibility Review

Status: demo-support evidence snapshot

This review strengthens the representative runtime feasibility demo by checking whether the selected slice has a real
legacy/canonical mismatch that affects current judgment.

## Derivation Notes

- The selected slice folder does not contain `.pbe/blueprint/*`, `.pbe/codex-execution-pack/*`, task-card files, or
  ACEP package files.
- The selected slice README includes a sample command flow that references `pbe acep ready`, but it does not make ACEP
  or task cards the selected-slice source authority.
- The demo-support Cycle Contract and Node Execution Contract are manual evidence snapshots, not runtime authority.

## Compatibility Path Judgment

```text
real selected-slice mismatch: not found
simulated mismatch: not used as real evidence
compatibility scenario status: not-applicable for real mismatch, partially demonstrated for policy handling
```

## Compatibility Control Node Candidate

No Compatibility Control Node is opened for this selected slice because no real selected-slice legacy/canonical mismatch
was found that affects current approval, scope, verification, or source authority judgment.

If a future supplemental slice includes `.pbe/blueprint/*`, `.pbe/codex-execution-pack/*`, or task-card-only wording
that conflicts with Cycle/Node Execution Contract authority, that mismatch should become a Compatibility Control Node
candidate instead of being silently ignored.

## Limitations

- This review does not inspect a live `.pbe` project because the repository root has no `.pbe` directory.
- This review does not prove compatibility behavior for all PBE examples.
- This review does not retire ACEP, task-card, or blueprint compatibility terms.
- This review does not promote Maintainability Graph or change source authority.

# Read-Model Validation Report

Status: validation-pass

Evidence level: validator-backed

## Run Identity

- Validated at: 2026-06-29T08:46:09.641Z
- Command identity: `devview graph read-model validate --slice examples/internal-legacy/adoption/todo-search-slice`
- Source commit: a1c4f10
- Source slice: `examples/internal-legacy/adoption/todo-search-slice`
- Profile id: `todo-search-selected-slice`
- Source layout: flat-demo-support
- Policy level: pilot-marker-backed
- Scope level: scoped-slice-validation

## Boundary

Validator-backed Evidence checks the bounded Todo Search read-model outputs only. It does not change source authority.

Validation pass is Evidence only. It does not promote Maintainability Graph, expand pilot scope, retire tree-native
artifacts, introduce CI enforcement, or replace user approval.

## Per-Slice Independence Contract

- Report unit: per-slice-validation-report
- Expected nodes: 40
- Expected edges: 59
- Expected validation checks: 20
- Generated read-model: examples/internal-legacy/adoption/todo-search-slice/generated/generated-read-model.json
- Parity requirement: pass (examples/internal-legacy/adoption/todo-search-slice/generated/read-model-parity-report.json)
- Pilot marker requirement: present
  (examples/internal-legacy/adoption/todo-search-slice/generated/scoped-source-authority-pilot-marker.json)
- Runtime fixture requirement: present
- Fallback/reference count: 8
- Missing fallback/reference count: 0

Validation uses the target slice profile, generated artifacts, and declared source inputs only. It must not depend on
another slice generated directory, manual parity artifact, pilot marker, or runtime fixture unless that artifact is
declared by this profile.

## Summary

- Checks: 20

## Retained Warnings

- RW-BOUNDED-FIXTURE: acceptable-warning - Bounded fixture Evidence is not full Todo app implementation.
- RW-PARTIAL-UI: acceptable-warning - UI screenshot/manual visual Evidence remains partial for the no-result empty
  state.
- RW-GENERATED-BUILDER: generated-present-for-bounded-slice - Generated read-model output and scoped validator-backed
  Evidence now exist for the bounded Todo Search slice; CI/full promotion repeatability remains later.
- RW-ACEP-CLEANUP: deferred-cleanup - ACEP task-card public-doc cleanup remains deferred.

## Recommended Next Decision Surface

- Continue active observation
- Design CI workflow integration before broader enforcement
- Apply scoped validator to another explicitly approved slice
- Perform public-doc cleanup
- Prepare broader Graph-source promotion review
- Rollback or defer scoped pilot

Status: demo-support evidence snapshot

This file records missing, partial, stale, or not-applicable evidence for the representative demo. An exception is not
proof. It is a visible limitation that supports user judgment.

| EX-SEARCH-001 | Fresh command output for `npm test -- todo-search` in this repository task. | exception       | Existing evidence snapshot says the command passed, but this evidence-strengthening task ran the bounded Vitest fixture instead.                                    | Historical product command output may not represent a live Todo app execution here.                  | Later review can run the historical command or explicitly accept bounded fixture Evidence as sufficient.                                                          |

| EX-SEARCH-003 | Evidence freshness after title + note Product Patch.                        | partial         | `PP-001` is confirmed; fresh bounded fixture Evidence now covers title + note/content behavior.                                                                     | Historical title-only evidence remains partial as a source of full-product proof.                    | Keep `EV-SEARCH-NOTE-TEST` linked and decide later whether full product/runtime evidence is required.                                                             |
| EX-SEARCH-004 | Real selected-slice compatibility mismatch.                                 | not-applicable  | No `.pbe/blueprint/*`, ACEP package, or task-card-only mismatch exists in the selected Todo slice folder.                                                           | Compatibility scenario is covered by supplemental slice, not by Todo product behavior.               | Keep supplemental compatibility evidence separate from Todo Search product evidence.                                                                              |

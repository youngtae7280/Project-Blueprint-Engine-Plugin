| EX-SEARCH-001 | Fresh command output for `npm test -- todo-search` in this repository task. | exception       | Existing evidence snapshot says the command passed, but this evidence-strengthening task ran the bounded Vitest fixture instead. | Historical product command output may not represent a live Todo app execution here.    | Later review can run the historical command or explicitly accept bounded fixture Evidence as sufficient.     |
| EX-SEARCH-002 | Screenshot or visual artifact for no-result empty state.                    | partial         | `EV-SEARCH-REVIEW` is a manual review note, not a screenshot.                                                                    | Visual state cannot be independently inspected from an image.                          | Add screenshot evidence if visual review becomes promotion-relevant.                                         |
| EX-SEARCH-003 | Evidence freshness after title + note Product Patch.                        | partial         | `PP-001` is confirmed; fresh bounded fixture Evidence now covers title + note/content behavior.                                  | Historical title-only evidence remains partial as a source of full-product proof.      | Keep `EV-SEARCH-NOTE-TEST` linked and decide later whether full product/runtime evidence is required.        |
| EX-SEARCH-004 | Real selected-slice compatibility mismatch.                                 | not-applicable  | No `.pbe/blueprint/*`, ACEP package, or task-card-only mismatch exists in the selected Todo slice folder.                        | Compatibility scenario is covered by supplemental slice, not by Todo product behavior. | Keep supplemental compatibility evidence separate from Todo Search product evidence.                         |
| EX-SEARCH-005 | Generated graph/read-model output.                                          | exception       | This demo uses manual Maintainability Graph read/alignment interpretation only.                                                  | Generated graph parity is not demonstrated.                                            | Later implementation may create generated read-model evidence after source-transition prerequisites are met. |
| EX-SEARCH-006 | Note/content search automated test output.                                  | resolved        | `npx vitest run examples/adoption/todo-search-slice/runtime-fixture` passed 1 file and 6 tests.                                  | Fixture proof is bounded and not a full Todo app implementation.                       | Treat `EV-SEARCH-NOTE-TEST` as present/fresh for the representative demo, with limitations visible.          |
| EX-SEARCH-007 | Renewed Acceptance for title + note/content search.                         | waiting         | Acceptance Tree is ready for renewed review with warnings, but the user has not accepted the expanded demo-support slice.        | Codex/PBE self-acceptance would hide the final user judgment.                          | Submit the refreshed Evidence and warnings for user acceptance review.                                       |

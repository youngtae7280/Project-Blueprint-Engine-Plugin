# Read-Model Validation Report

Status: validation-pass

Evidence level: validator-backed

## Run Identity

- Validated at: 2026-06-25T06:10:12.631Z
- Command identity: `pbe graph read-model validate --slice examples/adoption/todo-search-slice`
- Source commit: bc9bb24
- Source slice: `examples/adoption/todo-search-slice`
- Scope level: scoped-slice-validation

## Boundary

Validator-backed Evidence checks the bounded Todo Search read-model outputs only. It does not change source authority.

Validation pass is Evidence only. It does not promote Maintainability Graph, expand pilot scope, retire tree-native
artifacts, introduce CI enforcement, or replace user approval.

## Summary

- Checks: 20
- Passed: 20
- Warnings: 0
- Blocking: 0
- Decision required: 0

## Retained Warnings

- RW-BOUNDED-FIXTURE: acceptable-warning - Bounded fixture Evidence is not full Todo app implementation.
- RW-PARTIAL-UI: acceptable-warning - UI screenshot/manual visual Evidence remains partial for the no-result empty
  state.
- RW-GENERATED-BUILDER: generated-present-for-bounded-slice - Generated read-model output and scoped validator-backed
  Evidence now exist for the bounded Todo Search slice; CI/full promotion repeatability remains later.
- RW-ACEP-CLEANUP: deferred-cleanup - ACEP task-card public-doc cleanup remains deferred.

## Recommended Next Decision Surface

- Continue active observation
- Design CI workflow integration before broader enforcement
- Apply scoped validator to another explicitly approved slice
- Perform public-doc cleanup
- Prepare broader Graph-source promotion review
- Rollback or defer scoped pilot

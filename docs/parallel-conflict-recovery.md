# Parallel Conflict Recovery

If a parallel group fails during integration:

1. Stop group completion.
2. Mark the group as `integration_failed`.
3. Do not continue downstream tasks.
4. Create a conflict report.
5. Choose one:
   - merge safely in the integration task
   - rerun one task after rebasing on the other
   - downgrade remaining group to sequential
   - ask the user for scope adjustment

## Parallel Group Status

```ts
type ParallelGroupStatus =
  | 'not_started'
  | 'running'
  | 'integration_pending'
  | 'integration_passed'
  | 'integration_failed'
  | 'downgraded_to_sequential'
  | 'blocked'
```

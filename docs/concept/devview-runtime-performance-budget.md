# DevView Runtime Performance Budget

DevView should keep its deterministic runtime path fast enough to run during ordinary local work without becoming a
second full validation suite.

## Target

Target:

```text
deterministic DevView runtime path <= 5000ms
```

Scope:

- graph/read-model projection;
- contract or pack compilation;
- git-derived changed-file collection;
- non-enforcing compliance evaluation;
- result/report artifact generation;
- future graph delta proposal generation.

The target excludes:

- Codex or AI editing time;
- full test suite runtime;
- full validation suite runtime;
- CI runtime;
- human review time;
- Markdown documentation authoring;
- DEC authoring.

## Process And Runtime Separation

The product process can remain safe, reviewable, and staged while the runtime compiler/checker path stays fast.

`safe/reviewable/staged` describes how DevView decides what is allowed, what needs review, and what must never be
automated without approval.

`fast/deterministic/runtime` describes the local control-plane pass that reads already-known artifacts, compiles
contracts, collects changed-file names, runs advisory checks, and writes result summaries.

Full validation can take longer than 5 seconds. The runtime budget is not a replacement for full validation, CI
observation, or human review.

## Advisory Timing Smoke

The first timing smoke is:

```text
npm run devview:runtime:smoke
```

It runs:

- `node dist/cli/index.js graph read-model report-compiler-input --json`;
- `node dist/cli/index.js graph read-model compile-contract --dry-run --json`;
- `node dist/cli/index.js graph read-model collect-changed-files --base HEAD~1 --head HEAD --output .tmp/devview-runtime-timing-smoke/git-derived-changed-file-collection.json --json`.

The changed-file collection step writes to a `.tmp` smoke artifact so the timing smoke does not refresh the tracked
Todo App preview collection artifact during ordinary measurement.

The smoke reports JSON with:

- `runtimeBudgetTargetMs`;
- `measuredTotalMs`;
- `targetComparison`;
- `budgetStatus`;
- `advisoryOnly`;
- `runtimeBudgetEnforced`;
- `steps`.

The budget status is advisory. The smoke does not fail because the 5 second target is exceeded. It exits nonzero only
when a measured deterministic command itself fails.

The non-enforcing scope evaluator currently has a helper and advisory artifact, but no dedicated supported CLI command.
It is therefore listed as pending in the timing smoke rather than hidden or folded into a different command.

## Health Report Boundary

`graph read-model report-health --json` exposes a small runtime budget summary:

```text
runtimeBudgetTargetMs: 5000
lastTimingSmokeStatus: not-run-by-report-health
advisoryOnly: true
runtimeBudgetEnforced: false
```

The health report does not run the timing smoke. It only names the advisory surface and preserves the non-enforcement
boundary.

## Non-Goals

This budget does not:

- enforce the 5 second target;
- fail CI based on runtime timing;
- add required checks;
- add branch protection;
- reject diffs;
- enforce scope compliance;
- make the evaluator blocking;
- approve fixtures;
- mark calibration fixtures as supported;
- set `equivalenceProven: true`;
- inspect patch contents;
- implement graph delta apply;
- automate user acceptance;
- introduce executor automation.

# Dry-Run Scoped Limited Pilot Observation Record

Status: dry-run-scoped-limited-pilot-observation-record / review-only / source-authority-unchanged

## Document Purpose

This record observes the user-approved dry-run / review-only scoped pilot for the Todo Search limited pilot path.

It records whether the Graph-first read-model, View Instance Manifest, 7 Core Views, Approval Brief, Check/Evidence
records, and Control Node summary are usable as a review workflow for the selected slice.

It is not:

- source authority change
- scoped source-authority pilot execution
- full Graph-source promotion
- Maintainability Graph promotion to current operational source
- tree-native artifact retirement, deletion, or supersession
- public-doc cleanup
- CLI/schema/runtime/model/validator/generator implementation
- generated graph builder implementation
- Codex/PBE self-approval

## User Approval Trace

| Field           | Value                                          |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Approval source | parent orchestration chat                      |
| Approval date   | 2026-06-25                                     |
| Approved option | `Run dry-run / review-only scoped pilot first` |
| Approval scope  | Review-only dry-run observation                |

This approval authorizes this observation record. It does not approve scoped source-authority pilot execution.

## Dry-Run Scope

### Primary Scope

```text
examples/internal-legacy/adoption/todo-search-slice
```

The dry-run observes the Todo Search representative demo-support slice only.

### Supplemental Evidence Only

```text
examples/internal-legacy/adoption/compatibility-mismatch-slice
```

The compatibility mismatch slice supports compatibility-path observation. It is not pilot source scope.

### Explicit Non-Scope

This dry-run does not include:

- source authority change
- scoped source-authority pilot execution
- full Graph-source promotion
- public-doc cleanup
- CLI/schema/runtime/model/validator/generator implementation
- migration or rollback command implementation
- tree-native artifact retirement
- full Todo app implementation

## Source Authority Boundary

| Item                                             | Dry-run role                                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Tree-native selected-slice artifacts             | Current operational source for the selected slice.                           |
| Manual Maintainability Graph read-model artifact | Read/alignment Evidence for dry-run review; not source authority.            |
| View Instance Manifest                           | Projection Evidence for 7 Core Views; not source authority.                  |
| Dry-run observation record                       | Review-only observation; does not execute transition.                        |
| Compatibility mismatch supplemental slice        | Supporting Evidence for compatibility warning; not pilot source scope.       |
| Scoped source-authority pilot                    | Not started; requires a separate user approval and source boundary decision. |

## Observation Basis

The dry-run used reviewable artifacts, not AI self-report.

## Command Evidence

The runtime fixture command was rerun during this dry-run observation.

Command:

```bash
npx vitest run examples/internal-legacy/adoption/todo-search-slice/runtime-fixture
```

Observed result:

```text
1 test file passed
6 tests passed
```

This command Evidence is valid for the bounded representative fixture. It is not full Todo app implementation Evidence
and not generated graph-builder Evidence.

## Check / Evidence Observation

- AI self-report is not Evidence.
- Runtime fixture command Evidence is present/fresh for bounded title + note/content search.
- Manual read-model parity is Evidence for dry-run review, but not proof of generated builder or CLI-backed output.
- View Instance Manifest is projection Evidence for dry-run review, not source authority.
- Partial UI screenshot/manual visual Evidence remains a retained warning.
- ACEP task-card public-doc cleanup remains a deferred compatibility warning.
- Evidence exceptions remain visible and are not converted into proof.

## Control Node Observation

| Control area      | Observation                                                                                              | Dry-run status                              |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Decision          | Dry-run / review-only mode was selected by the user on 2026-06-25.                                       | resolved for this observation               |
| Evidence          | Manual parity is accepted for dry-run review; generated builder / CLI-backed output remains missing.     | active warning for repeatability/full scope |
| Compatibility     | ACEP task-card public-doc cleanup remains deferred and visible through supplemental compatibility slice. | deferred / active warning                   |
| Impact / Change   | Scoped source-authority change is not started; no authority-impact transition is executed.               | not started                                 |
| Acceptance        | Demo-support Acceptance is closed with retained warnings, but not promotion approval.                    | closed with warnings for demo slice only    |
| Source transition | Scoped source-authority pilot still requires separate approval and boundary evidence.                    | waiting for human decision                  |

## Dry-Run Result Classification

```text
usable-with-warnings
```

Reason:

- The manual read-model and View Instance Manifest are enough to reconstruct the selected-slice review workflow.
- The 7 Core Views expose product meaning, behavior, structure, scope/execution boundary, impact, verification, and
  evidence/acceptance.
- Runtime fixture Evidence is present/fresh for the bounded representative behavior.
- Retained warnings remain visible and materially limit any broader source-authority decision.

Warnings that remain:

- bounded fixture Evidence is not full Todo app implementation
- UI screenshot/manual visual Evidence is partial
- generated builder / CLI-backed read-model output is still missing
- ACEP task-card public-doc cleanup remains deferred
- scoped source-authority pilot execution has not started

## Next Decision Surface

After this dry-run, the user chose:

```text
Proceed to scoped source-authority pilot preparation
```

That choice is recorded in
[scoped-source-authority-pilot-preparation-package.md](scoped-source-authority-pilot-preparation-package.md). It
authorizes preparation only. It does not authorize actual scoped source-authority pilot execution.

The new next decision surface is:

1. `Approve actual scoped source-authority pilot execution with warnings`
2. `Require generated builder / CLI-backed read-model before execution`
3. `Require public-doc cleanup before execution`
4. `Strengthen evidence / run another dry-run`
5. `Defer scoped source-authority pilot`
6. `Reject scoped source-authority pilot`

The user selected option 2, `Require generated builder / CLI-backed read-model before execution`. The requirement is
recorded in [generated-read-model-evidence-requirement.md](generated-read-model-evidence-requirement.md). It does not
authorize implementation or source authority change.

Recommended next discussion:

```text
Decide whether generated builder output, public-doc cleanup, stronger rollback/fallback Evidence, or explicit
risk-accepted approval is required before actual scoped source-authority pilot execution.
```

This is a user decision. Codex/PBE cannot infer or self-approve it.

## Gate Self-Check

| Gate                           | Result | Notes                                                                                                 |
| ------------------------------ | ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Non-Promotion Gate             | PASS   | This record does not declare full Graph-source promotion or scoped source-authority execution.        |
| Execution Mode Separation Gate | PASS   | Dry-run observation, scoped source-authority pilot, and full promotion remain separate.               |
| Source Authority Boundary Gate | PASS   | Tree-native selected-slice artifacts remain current operational source.                               |
| User Approval Gate             | PASS   | The user selected dry-run only; the next authority-bearing step still needs explicit user judgment.   |
| Evidence Reality Gate          | PASS   | Observation points to reviewable files, command Evidence, and visible exceptions.                     |
| Rollback / Compatibility Gate  | PASS   | No rollback is needed because no source switch occurs; compatibility warnings are retained.           |
| Implementation Boundary Gate   | PASS   | No CLI, schema, runtime, validator, generator, migration, rollback, or public-doc cleanup is created. |

## Final Non-Promotion Statement

This dry-run observation does not execute scoped source-authority transition.

It does not promote Maintainability Graph, does not change current operational source, does not retire tree-native
artifacts, and does not approve full Graph-source promotion.

The next step requires an explicit user decision.

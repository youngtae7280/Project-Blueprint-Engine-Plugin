| ------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| DEC-001 | active | PBE is a Codex plugin workflow and tree-based development control system, not a GUI, SaaS backend, daemon, or separate OpenAI API provider.                                                                               | `README.md`, `docs/core-concepts.md`                                         |
| DEC-002 | active | PBE is optimized for safe, reviewable, staged project construction rather than speed.                                                                                                                                     | `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`                                                     |
| DEC-003 | active | The Product Tree is the source of product truth. Lower trees and execution artifacts derive from it.                                                                                                                      | `README.md`, `docs/tree-model.md`                                            |
| DEC-004 | active | Confirmed executable Product nodes require acceptance criteria or an explicit non-executable reason before downstream execution.                                                                                          | `AGENTS.md`, `docs/core-concepts.md`                                         |
| DEC-005 | active | Project, Work, and Test Trees derive from Product Tree branches; Work Tree nodes are not direct copies of Product nodes.                                                                                                  | `docs/tree-model.md`, `docs/workflow.md`                                     |
| DEC-006 | active | Cycle Contracts and Node Execution Contracts are the boundary between planning and implementation.                                                                                                                        | `docs/execution-contracts.md`                                                |
| DEC-007 | active | Codex may submit work for review, but only the user may accept product results.                                                                                                                                           | `docs/tree-model.md`, `docs/evidence-and-coverage.md`                        |
| DEC-008 | active | Feedback or drift that changes product meaning, scope, UX, risk, acceptance, or verification becomes a Change Node and flows through impact analysis.                                                                     | `docs/change-impact-revision.md`, `docs/workflow.md`                         |
| DEC-009 | active | The deterministic CLI is a file-based gate and state transition layer. It must not become a GUI, MCP server, daemon, or API caller.                                                                                       | `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`                                                     |
| DEC-010 | active | RPD, WPD, VD, ACEP, and Revision remain valid compatibility terms during the tree-native migration.                                                                                                                       | `README.md`, `docs/tree-model.md`                                            |
| DEC-011 | active | Existing "5 Layer" descriptions are legacy explanatory frames, not the active architecture baseline.                                                                                                                      | `AGENTS.md`, `docs/concept/glossary.md`                                      |
| DEC-012 | active | Actual runtime demo execution, source transition path, rollback/compatibility strategy, and implementation details remain next-phase candidates. Concept policies through Runtime Feasibility Demonstration are promoted. | Attached v2.1 work instruction; updated by Runtime Feasibility Demonstration |
| DEC-013 | active | Long-term target is to promote Maintainability Graph to the source model, but during the current transition tree-native artifacts remain the operational source of truth.                                                 | Transition stance decision                                                   |
| DEC-014 | active | Approval Brief is the user-facing judgment surface for interpreted intent, result, verification, remaining judgment, and approval choice. It does not expose internal graph or execution contract details by default.     | Approval Brief policy                                                        |
| DEC-015 | active | Approval Brief state labels are Ready for approval, Review with warning, Decision required, and Blocked; action labels are Approve this step, Request revision, Resolve required item, and Defer approval.                | Approval Brief policy                                                        |
| DEC-016 | active | Check and Evidence are separate concepts: Check is the verification obligation, Evidence is observable proof, AI self-report is not Evidence, and Evidence exceptions must be visible rather than treated as proof.       | Check/Evidence policy                                                        |
| DEC-017 | active | Control Nodes are control records for user judgment, change control, impact scope, acceptance closure, and block/reopen status. They do not replace Work, Evidence, Approval Brief, Acceptance Tree, or user approval.    | Control Node policy                                                          |
| DEC-018 | active | Legacy Compatibility Map is a transition interpretation policy, not a migration script or runtime source promotion. Legacy terms/artifacts may remain compatibility views when mapped and not treated as authority.       | Legacy Compatibility Map                                                     |
| DEC-019 | active | Runtime Feasibility Demonstration is a Graph-source promotion readiness gate, not source promotion. Representative feasibility requires observable Evidence and linked records, not AI self-report.                       | Runtime Feasibility Demonstration                                            |

## Supersede Relationships

| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| DEC-001      | Any description of PBE as a standalone app, SaaS, backend service, or API provider | The plugin workflow direction is explicit and stable.                                    |
| DEC-003      | Direct execution from unconfirmed user intent                                      | Product truth must be recorded before downstream work derives from it.                   |
| DEC-005      | Treating requirement nodes as direct coding tasks                                  | WPD must perform project and module derivation before executable work exists.            |
| DEC-006      | Task-card-only execution                                                           | Cycle and Node Execution Contracts are the canonical execution boundary.                 |
| DEC-011      | 5 Layer as active architecture                                                     | Current architecture is tree-native with skill, artifact, and CLI gate responsibilities. |

## Conflict Check

No active concept repository conflict is intentionally left unresolved in this pass.

DEC-013 does not supersede DEC-003. DEC-003 remains the current operational source decision, while DEC-013 records the
long-term Graph-source promotion target and the requirement for separate approval.

DEC-014 and DEC-015 do not supersede DEC-007. Approval Brief explains a user-facing judgment situation, while the user
remains the acceptance authority and Acceptance Tree remains the durable closure record.

DEC-016 does not replace DEC-006 or DEC-014. Execution Contracts may declare required Checks and Evidence obligations,
while Approval Brief summarizes them for user judgment and Acceptance Tree remains durable acceptance state.

DEC-017 does not replace DEC-008, DEC-014, DEC-016, or Acceptance Tree. Control Nodes explain workflow control points,
while Change/Impact artifacts, Approval Brief, Check/Evidence records, and durable acceptance state keep their separate
roles.

DEC-018 does not supersede DEC-013. Tree-native artifacts remain current operational source of truth until a separate
Graph-source promotion phase is explicitly approved.

DEC-019 does not supersede DEC-013, DEC-016, DEC-017, or DEC-018. It defines the feasibility-readiness standard while
tree-native artifacts remain operational source, Check/Evidence rules define proof, Control Nodes define workflow
control, and Legacy Compatibility Map defines compatibility interpretation.

Potential older language in public docs should be read through the compatibility terms in [glossary.md](glossary.md). If
future review finds a public doc still presenting superseded terminology as active architecture, record it in
[open-questions.md](open-questions.md) or [superseded-items.md](superseded-items.md) before changing product meaning.

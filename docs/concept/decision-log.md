# Concept Decision Log

This log is the source of truth for confirmed concept decisions in the PBE runtime architecture alignment work.

## Active Decisions

| ID      | Status | Decision                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Source                                                           |
| ------- | ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| DEC-001 | active | PBE is a Codex plugin workflow and tree-based development control system, not a GUI, SaaS backend, daemon, or separate OpenAI API provider.                                                                           | `README.md`, `docs/core-concepts.md`                             |
| DEC-002 | active | PBE is optimized for safe, reviewable, staged project construction rather than speed.                                                                                                                                 | `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`                                         |
| DEC-003 | active | The Product Tree is the source of product truth. Lower trees and execution artifacts derive from it.                                                                                                                  | `README.md`, `docs/tree-model.md`                                |
| DEC-004 | active | Confirmed executable Product nodes require acceptance criteria or an explicit non-executable reason before downstream execution.                                                                                      | `AGENTS.md`, `docs/core-concepts.md`                             |
| DEC-005 | active | Project, Work, and Test Trees derive from Product Tree branches; Work Tree nodes are not direct copies of Product nodes.                                                                                              | `docs/tree-model.md`, `docs/workflow.md`                         |
| DEC-006 | active | Cycle Contracts and Node Execution Contracts are the boundary between planning and implementation.                                                                                                                    | `docs/execution-contracts.md`                                    |
| DEC-007 | active | Codex may submit work for review, but only the user may accept product results.                                                                                                                                       | `docs/tree-model.md`, `docs/evidence-and-coverage.md`            |
| DEC-008 | active | Feedback or drift that changes product meaning, scope, UX, risk, acceptance, or verification becomes a Change Node and flows through impact analysis.                                                                 | `docs/change-impact-revision.md`, `docs/workflow.md`             |
| DEC-009 | active | The deterministic CLI is a file-based gate and state transition layer. It must not become a GUI, MCP server, daemon, or API caller.                                                                                   | `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`                                         |
| DEC-010 | active | RPD, WPD, VD, ACEP, and Revision remain valid compatibility terms during the tree-native migration.                                                                                                                   | `README.md`, `docs/tree-model.md`                                |
| DEC-011 | active | Existing "5 Layer" descriptions are legacy explanatory frames, not the active architecture baseline.                                                                                                                  | `AGENTS.md`, `docs/concept/glossary.md`                          |
| DEC-012 | active | Check/Evidence policy, Control Node policy, Legacy Compatibility Map, and feasibility demonstration stay outline-only or next-phase candidates until promoted by later decisions.                                     | Attached v2.1 work instruction; updated by Approval Brief policy |
| DEC-013 | active | Long-term target is to promote Maintainability Graph to the source model, but during the current transition tree-native artifacts remain the operational source of truth.                                             | Transition stance decision                                       |
| DEC-014 | active | Approval Brief is the user-facing judgment surface for interpreted intent, result, verification, remaining judgment, and approval choice. It does not expose internal graph or execution contract details by default. | Approval Brief policy                                            |
| DEC-015 | active | Approval Brief state labels are Ready for approval, Review with warning, Decision required, and Blocked; action labels are Approve this step, Request revision, Resolve required item, and Defer approval.            | Approval Brief policy                                            |

## Supersede Relationships

| New Decision | Supersedes                                                                         | Reason                                                                                   |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| DEC-001      | Any description of PBE as a standalone app, SaaS, backend service, or API provider | The plugin workflow direction is explicit and stable.                                    |
| DEC-003      | Direct execution from unconfirmed user intent                                      | Product truth must be recorded before downstream work derives from it.                   |
| DEC-005      | Treating requirement nodes as direct coding tasks                                  | WPD must perform project and module derivation before executable work exists.            |
| DEC-006      | Task-card-only execution                                                           | Cycle and Node Execution Contracts are the canonical execution boundary.                 |
| DEC-011      | 5 Layer as active architecture                                                     | Current architecture is tree-native with skill, artifact, and CLI gate responsibilities. |

## Conflict Check

No active concept repository conflict is intentionally left unresolved in this pass.

DEC-013 does not supersede DEC-003. DEC-003 remains the current operational source decision, while DEC-013 records the
long-term Graph-source promotion target and the requirement for separate approval.

DEC-014 and DEC-015 do not supersede DEC-007. Approval Brief explains a user-facing judgment situation, while the user
remains the acceptance authority and Acceptance Tree remains the durable closure record.

Potential older language in public docs should be read through the compatibility terms in [glossary.md](glossary.md). If
future review finds a public doc still presenting superseded terminology as active architecture, record it in
[open-questions.md](open-questions.md) or [superseded-items.md](superseded-items.md) before changing product meaning.

The three-real-PR observation count threshold is satisfied, so path-filter or failure-semantics refinement may be considered separately, but this decision does not change workflow filters, add enforcement, expand source authority, include invalid fixtures in CI, or approve full Graph-source promotion. | Third PR Informational Observation Review                                         |
| DEC-086 | active | PR informational path-filter and failure-semantics refinement is established as a design-only decision surface after PR #1, PR #2, and PR #3 satisfied the initial run-count observation threshold. Because all three reviewed PR runs were `ci-evidence-pass` with no blocker, repeated noise, missed artifact, hidden warning, or boundary ambiguity, the recommendation is to keep current path filters and failure semantics unchanged for now. Future narrowing, broadening, invalid-fixture CI, required checks, enforcement, source authority expansion, or promotion still require separate explicit decisions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | PR Informational Path-Filter Refinement                                           |

The ACEP row now frames ACEP as Cycle Contract and Node Execution Contract packaging, manifest, and evidence rules rather than ownership of executable task cards, and a rule states task cards are execution or compatibility views that do not replace Product, Work, Test, Evidence, Acceptance, Cycle Contract, or Node Execution Contract authority. Batch B is later implemented by DEC-091; Batch C/D, waiver approval, source authority expansion, Graph-source promotion, tree-native retirement, workflow/code/test/generated changes, enforcement, and user acceptance changes remain separate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Batch A Public-Doc Cleanup                                                        |

## Conflict Check

No active concept repository conflict is intentionally left unresolved in this pass.

DEC-013 does not supersede DEC-003. DEC-003 remains the current operational source decision, while DEC-013 records the
long-term Graph-source promotion target and the requirement for separate approval.

DEC-014 and DEC-015 do not supersede DEC-007. Approval Brief explains a user-facing judgment situation, while the user
remains the acceptance authority and Acceptance Tree remains the durable closure record.

DEC-016 does not replace DEC-006 or DEC-014. Execution Contracts may declare required Checks and Evidence obligations,
while Approval Brief summarizes them for user judgment and Acceptance Tree remains durable acceptance state.

DEC-017 does not replace DEC-008, DEC-014, DEC-016, or Acceptance Tree. Control Nodes explain workflow control points,
while Change/Impact artifacts, Approval Brief, Check/Evidence records, and durable acceptance state keep their separate
roles.

DEC-018 does not supersede DEC-013. Tree-native artifacts remain current operational source of truth until a separate
Graph-source promotion phase is explicitly approved.

DEC-019 does not supersede DEC-013, DEC-016, DEC-017, or DEC-018. It defines the feasibility-readiness standard while
tree-native artifacts remain operational source, Check/Evidence rules define proof, Control Nodes define workflow
control, and Legacy Compatibility Map defines compatibility interpretation.

DEC-020 does not supersede DEC-013 or DEC-019. Tree-native artifacts remain current operational source until explicit
promotion, and feasibility evidence remains a prerequisite rather than promotion itself.

DEC-021 does not supersede DEC-013, DEC-018, DEC-019, or DEC-020. It defines recovery and compatibility safety
requirements for a future transition while tree-native artifacts remain current operational source, Legacy Compatibility
Map continues to define compatibility interpretation, runtime feasibility remains a prerequisite, and Source Transition
Path remains the authority transition policy.

DEC-022 does not supersede DEC-019, DEC-020, or DEC-021. It selects the representative slice and Evidence review
criteria needed before actual demo execution, while Runtime Feasibility Demonstration remains the evidence-bearing gate,
Source Transition Path remains the authority policy, and Rollback / Compatibility Strategy remains the safety policy.

DEC-023 does not supersede DEC-019, DEC-020, DEC-021, or DEC-022. It records the observed result of the selected demo
slice, while partial findings remain promotion blockers or evidence-strengthening inputs and source authority remains
tree-native until explicit promotion.

DEC-024 does not supersede DEC-006, DEC-013, DEC-019, DEC-020, or DEC-023. Manual demo-support Project, Contract,
Change, Impact, Approval, Compatibility, or Evidence Exception artifacts may reduce review gaps, but they do not replace
CLI-generated runtime artifacts, source-transition prerequisites, or explicit user approval.

DEC-025 does not supersede DEC-006, DEC-018, DEC-020, DEC-023, or DEC-024. It records a real compatibility mismatch as
reviewable Evidence and a Control Node candidate, while Cycle and Node Execution Contracts remain the execution
boundary, Legacy Compatibility Map remains the interpretation policy, public-doc cleanup remains a separate judgment,
and source authority remains tree-native until explicit promotion.

DEC-026 does not supersede DEC-007, DEC-016, DEC-023, DEC-024, or DEC-025. It resolves the PP-001 product-meaning
decision for the manual demo-support slice, while Evidence remains observable-artifact based, Acceptance remains
user-controlled, compatibility cleanup remains deferred, and source authority remains unchanged.

DEC-027 does not supersede DEC-007, DEC-016, DEC-019, DEC-023, DEC-024, or DEC-026. It records fresh bounded runtime
fixture Evidence for the representative slice, while user Acceptance remains separate, AI self-report remains
non-evidence, Runtime Feasibility Demonstration remains a readiness gate, manual demo-support artifacts remain
non-authoritative, and source authority remains tree-native until explicit promotion.

DEC-028 does not supersede DEC-007, DEC-020, DEC-021, DEC-023, DEC-025, DEC-026, or DEC-027. It records explicit user
renewed Acceptance for the representative demo-support slice, while source promotion still requires source transition
boundaries, rollback/compatibility judgment, readiness review handling, retained warning outcomes, and explicit user
approval for promotion.

DEC-029 does not supersede DEC-013, DEC-019, DEC-020, DEC-021, DEC-023, DEC-027, or DEC-028. It records the readiness
review and warning classification, while Maintainability Graph remains a read/alignment model, source transition still
requires explicit user approval, rollback/compatibility strategy remains a prerequisite, demo Evidence remains scoped,
bounded fixture Evidence remains representative rather than full-product proof, and renewed Acceptance remains
demo-slice acceptance rather than promotion approval.

DEC-030 does not supersede DEC-013, DEC-020, DEC-021, DEC-027, DEC-028, or DEC-029. It resolves the read-model output
blocker only for limited pilot decision preparation, while generated builder output, full promotion repeatability,
source transition approval, rollback/compatibility safety, bounded fixture limits, and user promotion approval remain
separate.

DEC-031 does not supersede DEC-007, DEC-013, DEC-020, DEC-021, DEC-029, or DEC-030. It creates the user-facing decision
package for a limited pilot decision, while user acceptance authority, current tree-native source authority, source
transition prerequisites, rollback/compatibility safety, readiness warning classification, manual parity limits, and
explicit user promotion approval remain separate.

DEC-032 does not supersede DEC-003, DEC-013, DEC-018, DEC-020, or DEC-030. It refines the target Graph-first model and
read/alignment taxonomy while tree-native artifacts remain current operational source until explicit promotion.

DEC-033 does not supersede DEC-006, DEC-014, DEC-020, DEC-030, or DEC-031. It defines View Tree Pack as a projection and
adds Scope / Execution View, while Cycle/Node Execution Contracts remain the current execution boundary, Approval Brief
remains the user judgment surface, and limited pilot approval remains a user decision even after Graph-first parity
refresh.

DEC-034 does not supersede DEC-016, DEC-023, DEC-027, or DEC-030. It separates confidence from freshness/status while
Check/Evidence policy still controls proof and AI self-report remains non-evidence.

DEC-035 does not supersede DEC-003, DEC-005, DEC-013, or DEC-019. It defines a retrofit onboarding policy for existing
projects without PBE, while PBE-managed projects still use tree-native Product/Project/Work/Test/Evidence/Acceptance
artifacts as current operational source.

DEC-036 does not supersede DEC-007, DEC-016, DEC-020, or DEC-031. It constrains AI graph update proposals while user
acceptance authority, Evidence requirements, source-transition approval, and limited pilot decision authority remain
user- or evidence-gated.

DEC-037 does not supersede DEC-013, DEC-020, DEC-030, DEC-031, DEC-032, or DEC-033. It updates the manual limited-pilot
parity artifact under the new taxonomy while Maintainability Graph remains a read/alignment model, source transition
still requires explicit user approval, manual parity remains non-authoritative, and View Tree Pack remains a projection.

DEC-038 does not supersede DEC-013, DEC-020, DEC-021, DEC-031, or DEC-037. It records the user's bounded limited pilot
decision for the Todo Search selected slice after the Node/Edge/Tag refresh, while full Graph-source promotion, broad
source authority change, rollback/compatibility execution, generated builder support, public-doc cleanup, and
tree-native artifact retirement remain separate.

DEC-039 does not supersede DEC-020, DEC-021, DEC-030, DEC-031, or DEC-038. It plans the next execution-mode decision
after the bounded limited pilot approval, while the approval record remains non-executing, dry-run remains
non-authoritative, scoped source-authority pilot execution requires separate approval, and full Graph-source promotion
remains out of scope.

DEC-040 does not supersede DEC-020, DEC-021, DEC-030, DEC-031, DEC-038, or DEC-039. It records the user's dry-run mode
selection and the review-only observation result, while source transition policy, rollback/compatibility requirements,
manual parity limits, limited pilot decision boundaries, the bounded transition record, and the execution plan's
separation between dry-run and scoped authority execution remain active.

DEC-041 does not supersede DEC-020, DEC-021, DEC-030, DEC-031, DEC-038, DEC-039, or DEC-040. It prepares a user decision
surface for possible scoped authority execution, while source transition policy, rollback/fallback requirements, manual
parity limits, limited pilot decision boundaries, the execution plan, dry-run observation, and actual execution approval
remain separate.

DEC-042 does not supersede DEC-016, DEC-020, DEC-021, DEC-030, DEC-039, DEC-040, or DEC-041. It strengthens the Evidence
prerequisite before any authority-bearing scoped execution, while Check/Evidence policy, source transition policy,
rollback/fallback gates, manual parity limits, execution-mode separation, dry-run observation, preparation-package
boundaries, and future user approval remain active.

DEC-043 does not supersede DEC-016, DEC-020, DEC-021, DEC-030, DEC-039, DEC-040, DEC-041, or DEC-042. It designs the
future evidence output surface while Check/Evidence policy, source transition policy, rollback/fallback gates, manual
parity limits, execution separation, dry-run observation, preparation-package boundaries, generated Evidence
requirement, and future implementation/execution approvals remain active.

DEC-044 does not supersede DEC-016, DEC-020, DEC-021, DEC-030, DEC-039, DEC-040, DEC-041, DEC-042, or DEC-043. It
implements bounded Evidence generation and comparison for the Todo Search selected slice only. Generated output remains
Evidence, not source authority. Scoped source-authority execution was still unapproved at DEC-044 time and is later
handled separately by DEC-046.

DEC-045 does not supersede DEC-016, DEC-020, DEC-021, DEC-034, DEC-042, DEC-043, or DEC-044. It resolves a bounded
generated/manual parity warning review by aligning generated freshness/status mapping with source artifacts. It does not
make generated output source authority, does not execute a scoped source-authority pilot, and does not remove the need
for user approval before any source boundary changes.

DEC-046 does not supersede DEC-003, DEC-007, DEC-013, DEC-016, DEC-020, DEC-021, DEC-033, DEC-038, DEC-044, or DEC-045.
It executes a bounded Todo Search scoped pilot only. Tree-native selected-slice artifacts remain fallback/reference and
are not retired; user Acceptance authority remains user-controlled; full Graph-source promotion, repository-wide source
authority change, public-doc cleanup, and validator/CI enforcement remain separate future decisions.

DEC-047 does not supersede DEC-046. It reviews the bounded pilot after execution and keeps the same authority boundary:
Todo Search selected slice only, fallback ready, retained warnings visible, and no broader promotion.

DEC-048 does not supersede DEC-047. It records the observation mode after review: keep active with retained warnings,
watch trigger conditions, and require a separate user decision before validator/CI enforcement, public-doc cleanup,
broader promotion review, rollback/defer, or scope expansion.

DEC-049 does not supersede DEC-048. It responds to one active-observation trigger by defining validator/CI-backed
Evidence design only. It does not start validator implementation, add CI enforcement, or approve broader source
authority.

DEC-050 does not supersede DEC-046, DEC-047, DEC-048, or DEC-049. It implements scoped validator-backed Evidence for
Todo Search only. CI-backed Evidence, validator enforcement, public-doc cleanup, broader execution, full promotion
review, and any source authority expansion remain separate future decisions.

DEC-051 does not supersede DEC-050. It designs a future CI-backed Evidence workflow after local validator-backed
Evidence exists. It does not implement CI, make CI required, expand the scoped pilot, or change the source-transition
approval boundary.

DEC-052 does not supersede DEC-051. It implements only the first non-enforcing manual CI-backed Evidence workflow for
Todo Search. PR/push triggers, required-check enforcement, multi-slice validation, repo-wide promotion readiness,
public-doc cleanup, and source authority changes remain separate future decisions.

DEC-053 does not supersede DEC-052. It records an attempted manual workflow run review and preserves Evidence honesty:
the workflow exists, but no authenticated CI run artifact has been reviewed yet.

DEC-054 does not supersede DEC-052 or DEC-053. It resolves the CI run review blocker by recording the later authenticated
manual workflow run and artifact review, while preserving the same non-enforcement and source-authority boundaries.

DEC-055 does not supersede DEC-054. It uses the Todo Search local/CI-backed baseline as Evidence for designing later
multi-slice validation, but it does not broaden the active pilot or implement a second slice.

DEC-057 does not supersede DEC-056. It adds a second structure-only fixture/profile after the Todo Search extraction,
while keeping Todo Search as the only active scoped source-authority pilot.

DEC-058 does not supersede DEC-057. It strengthens the report contract for the existing two generated slices so they can
be read independently before any later aggregate reporting.

DEC-059 does not supersede DEC-058. It implements the first aggregate read-model Evidence summary over existing
per-slice validation reports only. The aggregate summary is Evidence-only and does not run validation, implement
`validate --all`, change CI workflows, expand source authority, promote Maintainability Graph, or replace user approval.

DEC-060 does not supersede DEC-052, DEC-054, DEC-057, DEC-058, or DEC-059. It extends the existing manual workflow to
produce Todo App structure-only and aggregate summary artifacts, but keeps the workflow non-enforcing and
manual-dispatch only. DEC-061 later records the aggregate-enabled run review without changing enforcement or authority.

DEC-061 does not supersede DEC-060. It records the observed aggregate-enabled workflow run and artifact review, while
PR/push triggers, required checks, branch protection, CI enforcement, `validate --all`, source authority expansion,
public-doc cleanup, and full Graph-source promotion remain separate future decisions.

DEC-062 does not supersede DEC-060 or DEC-061. It resolves the Node.js 20 CI hygiene warning observed in the historical
aggregate-enabled run by updating action/runtime settings and reviewing a post-update manual run, while preserving the
same non-enforcing workflow boundary and Evidence-only source-authority stance.

DEC-063 does not supersede DEC-060, DEC-061, or DEC-062. It designs a possible future PR-visible signal on top of the
reviewed manual workflow baseline. DEC-064 records the later workflow-change approval and implementation while keeping
enforcement, source authority, and promotion decisions separate.

DEC-064 does not supersede DEC-060, DEC-061, DEC-062, or DEC-063. It implements the PR-visible signal described by
DEC-063, while preserving manual dispatch, non-enforcement, source-authority boundaries, and full-promotion separation.
Required checks, branch protection, CI enforcement, `validate --all`, broader source authority, public-doc cleanup, and
PR run review remain separate decisions or evidence steps.

DEC-065 does not supersede DEC-064. It reviews the first real PR informational run and confirms the implementation's
artifact metadata and boundaries, while required checks, branch protection, CI enforcement, `validate --all`, broader
source authority, public-doc cleanup, path-filter refinement, and promotion decisions remain separate.

DEC-066 does not supersede DEC-064 or DEC-065. It defines how to observe additional PR informational runs after the first
review, while keeping path-filter changes, failure-semantics revisions, required checks, CI enforcement, `validate --all`,
broader source authority, public-doc cleanup, and promotion decisions separate.

DEC-067 does not supersede DEC-066. It provides the append-only log and runbook for applying the observation policy,
while keeping workflow changes, new PR creation, GitHub Actions dispatch, path-filter changes, required checks, CI
enforcement, `validate --all`, broader source authority, public-doc cleanup, and promotion decisions separate.

DEC-068 does not supersede DEC-059, DEC-066, or DEC-067. It defines the contract for a future all-slice validation
surface, while keeping the existing aggregate summary command report-only, the PR observation window active, and any CLI
implementation, workflow change, CI enforcement, source authority expansion, public-doc cleanup, or promotion decision
separate.

DEC-069 does not supersede DEC-068. It defines fixture and test strategy before implementation, while keeping actual
registry file creation, parser/planner implementation, `validate --all`, workflow changes, CI enforcement, source
authority expansion, public-doc cleanup, and promotion decisions separate.

DEC-070 does not supersede DEC-069. It records the storage/location and format decision surface for a future registry
file, while keeping candidate file creation, parser/planner implementation, `validate --all`, workflow changes, CI
enforcement, source authority expansion, public-doc cleanup, and promotion decisions separate. DEC-071 later resolves
the candidate file creation step only.

DEC-071 does not supersede DEC-070. It executes the approved candidate registry-file creation step while keeping parser
and planner consumption, `validate --all`, workflow changes, CI enforcement, source authority expansion, public-doc
cleanup, Todo App promotion beyond structure-only, and full Graph-source promotion separate.

DEC-072 does not supersede DEC-071. It adds parser/normalization and non-executing command-plan tests for the candidate
registry while keeping CLI command behavior, `validate --all`, workflow changes, CI enforcement, source authority
expansion, public-doc cleanup, Todo App promotion beyond structure-only, and full Graph-source promotion separate.

DEC-073 does not supersede DEC-059, DEC-060, or DEC-072. It adds a local registry-backed Evidence command that runs the
declared per-slice command plan before aggregate summary generation. The existing report-only summarize command and the
manual/PR CI workflow command sequence remain separate, and CI workflow consumption, required checks, enforcement,
source authority expansion, public-doc cleanup, Todo App promotion beyond structure-only, and full Graph-source
promotion remain unapproved.

DEC-074 does not supersede DEC-060, DEC-064, or DEC-073. It designs a possible future workflow simplification that would
call local `validate --all`, while keeping the current workflow unchanged and preserving PR observation, artifact
review, required-check/enforcement, source authority, public-doc cleanup, Todo App promotion, and full promotion as
separate decisions.

DEC-075 does not supersede DEC-064 or DEC-073. It changes only the non-enforcing workflow read-model command sequence to
call local `validate --all`; trigger policy, PR informational observation, required checks, enforcement, source
authority, public-doc cleanup, Todo App promotion, and full promotion remain separate decisions.

DEC-076 does not supersede DEC-064 or DEC-075. It records the first PR informational Evidence run after the validate-all
workflow switch, while keeping the workflow non-enforcing and preserving required checks, enforcement, source authority,
public-doc cleanup, Todo App promotion, and full promotion as separate future decisions.

DEC-077 does not supersede DEC-069 or DEC-073. It narrows where future invalid read-model fixtures should live, while
leaving actual fixture creation, parser/test implementation, CI invalid-fixture execution, enforcement, source
authority, public-doc cleanup, Todo App promotion, and full promotion as separate decisions.

DEC-078 does not supersede DEC-077. It narrows the first durable fixture candidate set while leaving fixture
implementation, focused tests, parser/validator behavior, CI invalid-fixture execution, enforcement, source authority,
public-doc cleanup, Todo App promotion, and full promotion as separate decisions.

DEC-086 does not supersede DEC-066, DEC-067, DEC-084, or DEC-085. It records a refinement recommendation after the
three-run observation threshold was satisfied, while keeping the workflow unchanged and preserving path-filter
implementation, failure-semantics changes, invalid-fixture CI, required checks, enforcement, source authority expansion,
public-doc cleanup, Todo App promotion, and full promotion as separate decisions.

DEC-087 does not supersede DEC-013, DEC-037, DEC-075, DEC-084, DEC-085, or DEC-086. It packages review inputs for a
future broader Graph-source promotion decision, while keeping actual promotion, source authority expansion, tree-native
retirement, workflow/code changes, CI enforcement, public-doc cleanup, invalid-fixture CI, Todo App promotion, rollback
execution, and user approval as separate future decisions.

DEC-088 does not supersede DEC-087 or public documentation. It creates the cleanup-or-waiver decision package only,
while keeping actual public-doc edits, waiver approval, promotion approval, source authority expansion, compatibility
retirement, enforcement, workflow/code changes, and user acceptance as separate decisions.

DEC-089 does not supersede DEC-088 or public documentation. It plans cleanup sequencing only, while keeping actual
public-doc edits, waiver approval, promotion approval, source authority expansion, compatibility retirement,
enforcement, workflow/code changes, and user acceptance as separate decisions.

DEC-090 does not supersede DEC-088 or DEC-089. It implements only Batch A in `docs/source-of-truth-matrix.md`, while
keeping later cleanup, waiver approval, source authority expansion, Graph-source promotion, tree-native retirement,
workflow/code/test/generated changes, enforcement, and user acceptance as separate decisions.

DEC-091 does not supersede DEC-088, DEC-089, or DEC-090. It implements only Batch B in `README.md`, `docs/acep.md`, and
`docs/workflow.md`, while keeping Batch C/D cleanup, waiver approval, source authority expansion, Graph-source
promotion, tree-native retirement, workflow/code/test/generated changes, enforcement, and user acceptance as separate
decisions.

DEC-092 does not supersede DEC-088, DEC-089, DEC-090, or DEC-091. It implements only Batch C in examples, usage,
traceability, and audit docs, while keeping optional Batch D review, waiver approval, source authority expansion,
Graph-source promotion, tree-native retirement, workflow/code/test/generated changes, enforcement, and user acceptance
as separate decisions.

DEC-093 does not supersede DEC-088, DEC-089, DEC-090, DEC-091, or DEC-092. It completes the optional Batch D review
surface only, while keeping waiver approval, promotion approval, source authority expansion, tree-native retirement,
workflow/code/test/generated changes, enforcement, and user acceptance as separate decisions.

DEC-094 does not supersede DEC-087, DEC-088, DEC-089, DEC-090, DEC-091, DEC-092, or DEC-093. It prepares a candidate
authority matrix and staged expansion design only, while keeping source authority expansion, Graph-source promotion,
tree-native retirement, public-doc cleanup edits, workflow/code/CLI/test/generated changes, enforcement, invalid-fixture
CI, Todo App promotion, and user acceptance as separate decisions.

DEC-095 does not supersede DEC-021, DEC-087, DEC-094, or existing rollback policy. It prepares a concrete docs-only
fallback plan for the candidate authority matrix, while keeping rollback execution, source authority expansion,
Graph-source promotion, tree-native retirement, public-doc cleanup edits, workflow/code/CLI/test/generated changes,
enforcement, invalid-fixture CI, Todo App promotion, and user acceptance as separate decisions.

DEC-096 does not supersede DEC-013, DEC-087, DEC-088, DEC-094, DEC-095, or user acceptance authority. It packages the
review inputs, cleanup status, authority matrix, rollback/fallback plan, and decision options for explicit user judgment
only. Actual Graph-source promotion, source authority expansion, tree-native retirement, enforcement, waiver approval,
rollback/defer action, and execution planning remain separate follow-up decisions after the user chooses a branch.

DEC-097 supersedes DEC-013 only within the approved Todo Search selected-slice authority surface. In that bounded scope,
Maintainability Graph is now the limited source model and tree-native selected-slice artifacts are maintained
compatibility / fallback / reference artifacts. DEC-013 remains active for all unpromoted scopes. DEC-097 does not
supersede DEC-003, DEC-007, DEC-016, DEC-021, DEC-073, DEC-075, DEC-084, DEC-095, or user acceptance authority. It does
not retire tree-native artifacts, promote Todo App beyond `structure-only`, add CI enforcement, add invalid fixtures to
CI, approve required checks, execute repo-wide promotion, or replace user-controlled acceptance.

DEC-098 does not supersede DEC-095 or DEC-097. It operationalizes observation criteria for the executed limited scope
only while preserving fallback/reference artifacts, non-enforcing CI, Todo App structure-only status, and user
acceptance boundaries.

DEC-099 does not supersede DEC-073, DEC-097, or DEC-098. It identifies the next implementation branch and recommended
storage/projection direction, while leaving artifact creation, parser/generator implementation, CLI/workflow changes,
generated output refresh, repo-wide promotion, tree-native retirement, and enforcement as future work.

DEC-100 does not supersede DEC-073, DEC-097, DEC-098, or DEC-099. It implements the first bounded source artifact and
internal projection proof only. CLI exposure, generated projection output refresh, schema hardening, repo-wide source
storage, workflow integration, enforcement, and artifact retirement remain future work.

DEC-101 does not supersede DEC-073, DEC-097, DEC-098, DEC-099, or DEC-100. It exposes the first bounded graph-source
projection output path only. Workflow integration, validate-all registry changes, schema hardening, repo-wide source
storage, enforcement, tree retirement, invalid-fixture CI inclusion, and Todo App promotion remain future work.

DEC-102 does not supersede DEC-073, DEC-097, DEC-098, DEC-099, DEC-100, or DEC-101. It hardens the bounded Todo Search
source/projection contract only. Workflow integration, validate-all registry changes, enforcement, repo-wide source
authority, tree retirement, invalid-fixture CI inclusion, and Todo App promotion remain future work.
DEC-103 does not supersede DEC-073, DEC-097, DEC-098, DEC-099, DEC-100, DEC-101, or DEC-102. It integrates the bounded
projection contract into local validate-all only. Workflow changes, CI enforcement, repo-wide authority, tree
retirement, invalid-fixture CI inclusion, and Todo App promotion remain future work.

DEC-104 does not supersede DEC-073, DEC-097, DEC-098, DEC-099, DEC-100, DEC-101, DEC-102, or DEC-103. It exposes
the local projection contract status in non-enforcing CI artifacts only. Manual/PR observation is reviewed; enforcement,
repo-wide authority, tree retirement, invalid-fixture CI inclusion, and Todo App promotion remain future work.

DEC-105 supersedes only the DEC-101 statement that default Todo Search generation was unchanged. It does not supersede
DEC-097 through DEC-104 otherwise: the change is bounded to Todo Search generated read-model record sourcing and does
not change workflow triggers, enforcement, repo-wide authority, fallback retention, tree retirement, invalid-fixture CI,
or Todo App `structure-only` status.

DEC-106 does not supersede DEC-097 through DEC-105. It adds the first Todo App PBE Run graph-source candidate artifact
and focused candidate validation tests only. The artifact is structure-only review input, is not consumed by
`validate --all`, is not enrolled in CI or the positive registry, does not add parity/pilot-marker requirements, and does
not promote Todo App PBE Run beyond `structure-only`.

DEC-107 does not supersede DEC-097 through DEC-106. It exposes explicit projection for the Todo App PBE Run
structure-only candidate and commits the generated candidate projection artifact. The projection preserves the 22-node /
38-edge / 7-Core-View shape, but remains candidate Evidence only; it is not consumed by validate-all, is not enrolled in
CI or the positive registry, and does not promote Todo App PBE Run beyond `structure-only`.

DEC-108 does not supersede DEC-097 through DEC-107. It adds an internal committed-artifact contract check for the Todo
App PBE Run candidate projection only. The check preserves candidate/structure-only boundaries and rejects
source-authority creation or validate-all enrollment claims, while leaving positive validate-all, CI workflow behavior,
enforcement, and Todo App promotion unchanged.

DEC-109 does not supersede DEC-097 through DEC-108. It adds local `graph read-model observe-candidates` reporting for
candidate projection contracts outside positive validate-all semantics. The command can block on candidate projection
drift, but it does not modify the positive registry, aggregate summary, CI workflow, enforcement policy, or Todo App
source-authority status.

DEC-110 does not supersede DEC-097 through DEC-109. It captures `graph read-model observe-candidates` output in the
non-enforcing read-model Evidence workflow as separate CI artifact metadata and Step Summary fields only. Candidate
observation remains separate from `validateAllStatus`, `aggregateStatus`, the positive registry, enforcement, and Todo
App source-authority status.

DEC-111 does not supersede DEC-097 through DEC-110. It records manual CI review of candidate-observation artifact
capture in run `28221088498` and a small manifest artifact list fix before that review. The reviewed workflow remains
manual/PR informational only and does not enroll Todo App in positive validate-all, source authority, enforcement, or
promotion.

DEC-112 does not supersede DEC-097 through DEC-111. It records PR informational review of candidate-observation artifact
capture in PR #6 run `28221326457`. The review confirms PR metadata plus candidate observation fields while preserving
positive validate-all, aggregate status, non-enforcement, and Todo App `structure-only` boundaries.

DEC-113 does not supersede DEC-097 through DEC-112. It prepares the Todo App graph-source enrollment decision package
only. The recommended next safe branch is bounded non-authority enrollment in positive validate-all, but registry,
workflow, CLI behavior, source authority, Todo App promotion, enforcement, and tree retirement remain unchanged.

DEC-114 does not supersede DEC-097 through DEC-113. It implements bounded non-authority Todo App projection-contract
enrollment in local positive `validate --all` only. Todo App remains `structure-only`, not parity-backed,
not pilot-marker-backed, not source-authority-bearing, and not promoted. Workflow behavior, CI review, repo-wide
promotion, tree retirement, enforcement, invalid-fixture CI, and required checks remain future decisions.

DEC-115 does not supersede DEC-097 through DEC-114. It updates the main README to describe the current mixed
Graph-source transition state: Todo Search selected scope is limited Graph-source promoted and graph-source-backed,
tree-native artifacts remain source/fallback as applicable, Todo App remains structure-only/non-authority, and
repo-wide promotion, tree retirement, enforcement, and required checks remain incomplete.

DEC-116 does not supersede DEC-097 through DEC-115. It records manual CI review of Todo App bounded non-authority
projection-contract enrollment in run `28222731063`. The run confirms Todo App positive validate-all
`candidate-projection-contract-pass`, Todo Search `projection-contract-pass`, aggregate pass, and separate candidate
observation metadata, without workflow behavior changes, source authority expansion, promotion, or enforcement.

DEC-117 does not supersede DEC-097 through DEC-116. It records PR informational CI review of the same Todo App bounded
non-authority projection-contract enrollment in PR #7 run `28223010185`. The smoke PR was closed without merge and the
branch was deleted; no workflow behavior change, source authority expansion, promotion, enforcement, required check, or
tree retirement is introduced.

DEC-118 does not supersede DEC-097 through DEC-117. It adds local `npm run test:read-model:e2e` dogfood coverage for the
mixed Graph-source transition in a temporary workspace. The smoke checks Todo Search graph-source-backed
generate/compare/validate/projection, Todo App structure-only generate/validate/non-authority projection, validate-all
aggregate pass, and separate candidate observation without CI enforcement, required checks, repo-wide promotion, tree
retirement, or Todo App source-authority promotion.

DEC-119 does not supersede DEC-097 through DEC-118. It integrates the E2E smoke into the non-enforcing read-model
Evidence workflow as observation metadata and uploads `read-model-e2e-smoke-output.json`. The integration records
`e2eSmokeStatus` in the CI manifest and Step Summary without adding required checks, enforcement, repo-wide promotion,
tree retirement, or Todo App source-authority promotion.

DEC-120 does not supersede DEC-097 through DEC-119. It records manual CI review of E2E smoke observation in run
`28223860233`. The reviewed artifact confirms `e2eSmokeStatus: e2e-smoke-pass`, Todo Search
`projection-contract-pass`, Todo App `candidate-projection-contract-pass`, validate-all aggregate pass, and separate
candidate observation metadata without adding enforcement, repo-wide promotion, tree retirement, or Todo App
source-authority promotion.

DEC-121 does not supersede DEC-097 through DEC-120. It records PR informational review of E2E smoke observation in PR
#8 run `28224088829`. The smoke PR was closed without merge and the branch was deleted; the reviewed artifact confirms
the same E2E smoke, projection, validate-all, and candidate-observation statuses without adding enforcement, repo-wide
promotion, tree retirement, or Todo App source-authority promotion.

DEC-122 does not supersede DEC-097 through DEC-121. It makes Todo App PBE Run structure-only generation
graph-source-candidate-backed locally: `graph read-model generate --slice examples/valid/todo-app-pbe-run` reads
`graph-source-candidate.json`, preserves 22 nodes / 38 edges / 7 Core Views and validation pass, and records
`non-authority-structure-only` metadata. Todo App remains structure-only, candidate/non-promotional, not
source-authority-bearing, and not repo-wide promotion.

DEC-123 does not supersede DEC-097 through DEC-122. It records manual CI review of Todo App graph-source-candidate-backed
generation metadata in run `28224636333`. The reviewed artifact confirms `readModelSourceMode: graph-source-backed`,
`graphSourceAuthorityStatus: non-authority-structure-only`, Todo App 22/38/7 validation/projection pass, Todo Search
projection pass, E2E smoke pass, and validate-all aggregate pass without Todo App source-authority promotion,
repo-wide promotion, tree retirement, enforcement, or required checks.

DEC-124 does not supersede DEC-097 through DEC-123. It records PR informational CI review of the same Todo App
graph-source-candidate-backed generation metadata in PR #9 run `28224878648`. The smoke PR was closed without merge and
the branch was deleted; the reviewed artifact confirms PR metadata plus the same Todo App/Todo Search/E2E/validate-all
statuses without Todo App source-authority promotion, repo-wide promotion, tree retirement, enforcement, or required
checks.

DEC-125 does not supersede DEC-097 through DEC-124. It confirms Todo App PBE Run as a graph-source-backed
`structure-only` slice: `graph read-model generate --slice examples/valid/todo-app-pbe-run` reads
`examples/valid/todo-app-pbe-run/graph-source.json`, positive `validate --all` checks
`generated/graph-source-read-model-projection.json` as `projection-contract-pass`, and E2E smoke records
`confirmed-structure-only-graph-source`. This is graph-source confirmation only and does not add enforcement, required
checks, tree retirement, invalid-fixture CI, parity backing, pilot-marker backing, or promotion beyond `structure-only`.

DEC-126 does not supersede DEC-097 through DEC-125. It records manual run `28226270934` and PR #10 run `28226357099`
reviewing confirmed Todo App graph-source-backed metadata in non-enforcing CI. The reviewed artifacts record Todo App
`projection-contract-pass`, `structure-only-confirmed`, `confirmed-structure-only-graph-source`, 22 nodes / 38 edges /
7 Core Views, E2E smoke pass, validate-all aggregate pass, and uploaded `graph-source-read-model-projection.json`.
Workflow triggers remain manual plus PR informational; no enforcement, required check, tree retirement, invalid-fixture
CI, or promotion beyond `structure-only` is introduced.

DEC-127 does not supersede DEC-097 through DEC-126. It records repo-wide Graph-source transition mechanics after Todo
Search and Todo App PBE Run both became graph-source-backed configured read-model slices.
`examples/read-model-aggregate/graph-source-transition-status.json` records the confirmed source direction, Todo Search
as `limited-graph-source-promoted`, Todo App as `confirmed-structure-only-graph-source`, and tree-native artifacts as
compatibility/fallback/reference. The slice registry is marked `active-consumed-by-validate-all`, and the local E2E
smoke checks the status artifact. This mechanics step does not retire tree-native artifacts, add required checks, enable
CI enforcement, include invalid fixtures in CI, or promote Todo App beyond `structure-only`.

DEC-128 does not supersede DEC-097 through DEC-127. It adds native and retrofit intent-critical Graph-source maintenance
examples under `examples/intent-critical/` plus focused tests. The examples record UX/acceptance intent, non-goals,
fallback/rollback reasons, evidence reasons, and compatibility reasons so AI-assisted maintenance cannot silently change
behavior when original intent is missing. This is example/validation surface only; it does not add tree retirement,
enforcement, required checks, invalid-fixture CI, or repo-wide source authority expansion.

DEC-129 does not supersede DEC-097 through DEC-128. It records the edge-level intent vocabulary direction:
Graph-source remains the single source direction, intent is primarily graph edge annotation, node intent is supporting
context, concrete intent stays as short project-specific edge `claim` text, and vocabulary/table values are limited to
repeatable classifications such as type, intent kind, risk kind, signal kind, confidence, enforcement, source role, and
lifecycle status. Native and retrofit PBE use the same edge-intent model and differ by signal origin/confidence only.
This is design/fixture alignment only and does not add broad schema enforcement, required checks, tree retirement, or a
separate intent source.

DEC-130 does not supersede DEC-097 through DEC-129. It adds a minimal intent-critical projection surface for the native
and retrofit fixtures: `generated/edge-intent-read-model-projection.json` preserves edge-level intent classifications,
project-specific `claim`, confidence, enforcement, anchors, and a human-readable summary. Focused tests compare the
projection against the source `edgeIntent` and prove the claim is not replaced by enum/table vocabulary. This remains
intent projection surface only and is not integrated into broad validate-all, enforcement, required checks, or tree
retirement.

DEC-131 does not supersede DEC-097 through DEC-130. It adds the small `graph read-model project-intent --graph-source
<path> --output <path> --json` CLI/report surface for intent-critical native/retrofit fixtures. The command regenerates
the existing edge-intent read-model projection shape, preserves project-specific claims and vocabulary classifications,
and reports clear validation failures when required classifications or anchors are missing. It remains separate from
broad validate-all, enforcement, required checks, and tree retirement.

DEC-132 does not supersede DEC-097 through DEC-131. It adds non-enforcing CI observation of the native and retrofit
edgeIntent projection command to `.github/workflows/read-model-evidence.yml`. The workflow now records
`edgeIntentProjectionObservationStatus` in the CI manifest and Step Summary and uploads the native/retrofit projection
files plus command outputs. This is intent projection CI observation only and does not integrate intent projection into
broad validate-all enforcement, required checks, or tree retirement.

DEC-133 does not supersede DEC-097 through DEC-132. It records manual workflow run `28346777344` reviewing the new
edgeIntent projection CI observation surface. The artifact manifest records
`edgeIntentProjectionObservationStatus: edge-intent-projection-pass`, native and retrofit command outputs both report
`intent-projection-pass`, both projection artifacts are uploaded, validate-all remains `aggregate-pass`, and the E2E
smoke remains `e2e-smoke-pass`. This review does not add PR-required enforcement, broad intent schema enforcement, or
tree retirement.

DEC-134 does not supersede DEC-097 through DEC-133. It records PR #11 run `28346897073` reviewing the same edgeIntent
projection CI observation surface in `pull_request-informational` mode. The smoke PR was closed without merge and its
remote branch was deleted; the reviewed artifact confirms PR metadata, `edgeIntentProjectionObservationStatus:
edge-intent-projection-pass`, native and retrofit `intent-projection-pass`, validate-all `aggregate-pass`, and E2E smoke
pass without required checks, broad intent schema enforcement, or tree retirement.

DEC-135 does not supersede DEC-097 through DEC-134. It adds the local
`graph read-model report-intent --json` report/validation surface for native and retrofit edgeIntent projections. The
report summarizes fixture count, edgeIntent count, claim count, classification count, anchor count, missing
classification count, and missing anchor count, and blocks locally when required classifications or anchors are missing.
It remains local intent report/validation only and does not add broad validate-all intent enforcement, required checks,
or tree retirement.

DEC-136 does not supersede DEC-097 through DEC-135. It adds `report-intent` coverage to the local
`npm run test:read-model:e2e` smoke. The smoke now verifies `intent-report-pass`, native/retrofit summaries, nonzero
edgeIntent/claim/classification/anchor counts, and zero missing classification/anchor counts while preserving the same
non-enforcing E2E boundary.

DEC-137 does not supersede DEC-097 through DEC-136. It records manual workflow run `28348764191` reviewing the E2E
smoke after `report-intent` coverage was added. The artifact manifest records `e2eSmokeStatus: e2e-smoke-pass`, and the
uploaded E2E output records `intentReport.status: intent-report-pass`, native/retrofit fixture summaries, nonzero
edgeIntent/claim/classification/anchor counts, zero missing classification/anchor counts, and validate-all
`aggregate-pass`. This remains manual CI observation only and does not add broad intent schema enforcement, required
checks, or tree retirement.

DEC-138 does not supersede DEC-097 through DEC-137. It records PR #12 run `28348903718` reviewing the same E2E
`intentReport` visibility in `pull_request-informational` mode. The smoke PR was closed without merge and its remote
branch was deleted; the reviewed artifact confirms PR metadata, `e2eSmokeStatus: e2e-smoke-pass`,
`intentReport.status: intent-report-pass`, native/retrofit summaries, zero missing classification/anchor counts, and
validate-all `aggregate-pass` without broad intent schema enforcement, required checks, or tree retirement.

DEC-139 does not supersede DEC-097 through DEC-138. It records tree-native compatibility/fallback/reference retirement
readiness criteria in `examples/read-model-aggregate/graph-source-transition-status.json` and verifies those fields in
the local E2E smoke. Current readiness remains `retirement-not-ready`: Todo Search is
`closer-but-not-retirement-ready` pending explicit retirement approval, and Todo App is `not-retirement-ready` because
source authority beyond `structure-only` is not approved. This is retirement criteria/readiness only and does not retire
tree-native artifacts, add enforcement, or enable required checks.

DEC-140 does not supersede DEC-097 through DEC-139. It prepares
`tree-native-retirement-approval-package.md` and status-artifact references for Todo Search, Todo App PBE Run, and
repo-wide tree-native retirement decisions. Todo Search is classified as `approval-candidate-not-approved`; Todo App is
`not-ready-structure-only`; repo-wide retirement is `not-ready`. The E2E smoke verifies those package statuses, but no
tree-native artifact is retired, deprecated, deleted, enforced, or required-check gated.

DEC-141 does not supersede DEC-097 through DEC-140. It adds local
`graph read-model report-health --json` as a non-enforcing Graph-source transition health summary. The report reads
existing validate-all aggregate output, projection contracts, edgeIntent report health, transition status, retirement
readiness, and retirement approval package statuses. It is local reporting only and does not rerun E2E, mutate generated
artifacts, add required checks, enforce CI, or approve tree-native retirement.

DEC-142 does not supersede DEC-097 through DEC-141. It captures `graph read-model report-health --json` in the
non-enforcing read-model Evidence workflow and records manual run `28350824272` reviewing
`healthReportStatus: graph-source-health-pass`, validate-all `aggregate-pass`, edgeIntent `intent-report-pass`,
retirement readiness `retirement-not-ready`, and enforcement status `non-enforcing`. This is CI observation only and
does not add required checks, enforcement, or tree-native retirement.

DEC-143 does not supersede DEC-097 through DEC-142. It records PR #13 run `28351078223` reviewing the same graph-source
health report visibility in `pull_request-informational` mode. The reviewed artifact confirms PR metadata,
`healthReportStatus: graph-source-health-pass`, validate-all `aggregate-pass`, edgeIntent `intent-report-pass` with 2
edgeIntent records, retirement readiness `retirement-not-ready`, and enforcement status `non-enforcing`; the smoke PR
was closed unmerged and its branch/temp artifacts were removed. This remains PR health CI observation only and does not
add actual retirement, enforcement, or required checks.

DEC-144 does not supersede DEC-097 through DEC-143. It adds a human-readable Markdown companion output for
`graph read-model report-health --json --markdown <path>` and includes `read-model-health-report-output.md` in the
non-enforcing read-model Evidence workflow artifact bundle, manifest, and Step Summary. The Markdown summary improves
review discoverability for overall health, source status, validate-all/E2E/edgeIntent status, retirement readiness,
retirement package status, boundaries, and reproduction commands. It does not add actual retirement, enforcement,
required checks, or source authority changes.

DEC-145 does not supersede DEC-097 through DEC-144. It records manual workflow run `28351612200` reviewing the health
Markdown summary artifact after DEC-144. The artifact bundle includes
`examples/read-model-aggregate/generated/read-model-health-report-output.md`; the CI manifest includes the Markdown
artifact path; the Markdown content includes overall health, Todo Search/Todo App source status, validate-all,
edgeIntent, retirement readiness/package status, non-enforcement boundaries, and reproduction commands. This remains
manual CI observation only and does not add actual retirement, enforcement, or required checks.

DEC-146 does not supersede DEC-097 through DEC-145. It records PR #14 run `28351775566` reviewing health Markdown
summary artifact visibility in `pull_request-informational` mode. The reviewed artifact confirms PR metadata,
`read-model-health-report-output.md` presence, manifest artifact-path visibility, `graph-source-health-pass`,
`aggregate-pass`, `intent-report-pass`, retirement readiness/package statuses, and the `non-enforcing` boundary. The
smoke PR was closed unmerged and its branch/temp artifacts were removed. This remains PR health Markdown observation
only and does not add actual retirement, enforcement, or required checks.

DEC-147 does not supersede DEC-097 through DEC-146. It applies narrow Todo Search fallback/reference deprecation
mechanics only: tree-native selected-slice artifacts are now marked `deprecated-fallback-reference-not-deleted`, not
source for graph-source-backed Todo Search read-model generation, and still retained for rollback. Todo App remains
`not-ready-structure-only`, repo-wide retirement remains `not-ready`, no files are deleted, and no required check,
branch protection, or enforcement setting is enabled.

DEC-148 does not supersede DEC-097 through DEC-147. It adds non-enforcing CI observation for the PBE operation-chain
dogfood package by running `scripts/invoke-pbe-v0.ps1 -Command operation-chain` and `-Command evaluate-dogfood` in the
read-model Evidence workflow. The CI manifest, Step Summary, and artifact bundle now expose `operationChainStatus`,
`dogfoodEvaluationStatus`, and the generated `outputs/` reports. This is observation only and does not add required
checks, branch protection, tree retirement, enforcement, or source-authority expansion.

DEC-149 does not supersede DEC-097 through DEC-148. It records manual workflow run `28423595270` reviewing the
operation-chain CI observation after a failed first run exposed Linux path and BOM parsing portability gaps. The
successful rerun records `ci-evidence-pass`, `operationChainStatus: pbe-operation-chain-pass`, and
`dogfoodEvaluationStatus: pbe-dogfood-evaluation-pass`, with both `outputs/pbe-operation-chain` reports present in the
artifact bundle. This remains non-enforcing CI observation only.

DEC-150 does not supersede DEC-097 through DEC-149. It records PR #15 run `28423731988` reviewing the same
operation-chain CI observation in `pull_request-informational` mode. The artifact manifest includes PR metadata,
`operationChainStatus: pbe-operation-chain-pass`, and `dogfoodEvaluationStatus: pbe-dogfood-evaluation-pass`; the
operation-chain and dogfood reports are present in the artifact bundle. The temporary PR was closed unmerged and the
smoke branch was deleted. This remains non-enforcing CI observation only.

DEC-151 does not supersede DEC-097 through DEC-150. It records the first real external operation-chain dogfood against a
local `mdn/todo-vue` checkout at `8a7ef579f1d117a8ac9530a52f5c5a81c3e99676`. PBE recovered a bounded retrofit graph
source, generated an instruction pack, applied only a local README clarification, captured a graph delta with one dirty
file and three additions, and generated a graph update proposal without mutating graph-source. `npm ci` passed, while
`npm run build` was recorded as blocked by the local Node/toolchain baseline rather than the selected README-only slice.
No upstream PR, maintainer approval claim, required check, enforcement, source-authority expansion, or tree retirement is
introduced.

DEC-152 does not supersede DEC-097 through DEC-151. It records the first real external behavior-change dogfood against a
local `component/escape-html` checkout at `b42947eefa79efff01b3fe988c4c7e7b051ec8d8`. PBE recovered stringification and
escaping intent from README/source/tests, generated an instruction pack, applied a bounded code/test change
(`String(value)` coercion plus a Symbol assertion), passed the external project's `npm test` suite with 31 tests, captured
a graph delta for `index.js` and `test/index.js`, and generated a graph update proposal without mutating graph-source.
No upstream PR, maintainer approval claim, required check, enforcement, source-authority expansion, or tree retirement is
introduced.

DEC-153 does not supersede DEC-097 through DEC-152. It adds `pbe graph operation apply-proposal` as the first CLI surface
for graph update proposal review/application. The command defaults to dry-run preview, validates proposal/delta/source
alignment and stale current-state boundaries, and only writes graph-source node/record status fields when explicit
`--apply` is provided. This is implementation/UX completion for the proposal application flow; it does not apply target
code patches, create upstream PRs, enable enforcement, add required checks, or retire tree-native artifacts.

DEC-154 does not supersede DEC-097 through DEC-153. It adds `pbe graph operation run-chain` as a CLI wrapper around the
existing plugin-local operation-chain script. `--dry-run` returns the wrapped command plan without executing PowerShell;
running without `--dry-run` delegates to `scripts/invoke-pbe-v0.ps1` and preserves the script's existing output behavior.
This improves implementation/UX by removing the need to remember the script path. It does not replace the script
implementation, apply graph proposals, enable enforcement, add required checks, or retire tree-native artifacts.

DEC-155 does not supersede DEC-097 through DEC-154. It adds `pbe graph retrofit plan` as a target-safe retrofit start UX.
The command reads an active retrofit graph-source and reports target summary, implementation-ready records, retained
reference records, forbidden-flow boundaries, edgeIntent coverage, and next inputs before instruction-pack generation or
target-code changes. It does not mutate the target project, apply patches, infer maintainer approval, enable enforcement,
or retire tree-native artifacts.

DEC-156 does not supersede DEC-097 through DEC-155. It adds explicit CLI operation-chain steps:
`pbe graph operation generate-pack`, `pbe graph operation capture-delta`, and `pbe graph operation propose-update`.
Together they cover graph-source record selection, instruction-pack generation, target git-diff capture, graph-delta
creation, and graph update proposal generation without requiring users to call the underlying PowerShell scripts
directly. `generate-pack` preserves the existing `generated-from-graph-source` instruction-pack status,
`capture-delta` blocks dirty files outside the allowed instruction-pack scope, and `propose-update` creates a
review-required graph update proposal. These commands do not patch target repos, mutate graph-source automatically,
claim maintainer approval, enable enforcement, add required checks, or retire tree-native artifacts.

DEC-157 does not supersede DEC-097 through DEC-156. It adds the user-facing Graph Operation Runbook and
`npm run test:graph-operation:flow` smoke. The runbook gives the practical sequence from graph inspection through
instruction-pack generation, bounded target change, graph-delta capture, graph update proposal generation,
`apply-proposal` preview, and explicit `--apply`. The smoke creates an isolated temporary target git repo and exercises
that CLI sequence without touching external projects or committed graph-source fixtures. This improves usability and
regression coverage only; it does not add required checks, enforcement, target patching, upstream PR creation, source
authority expansion, or tree-native retirement.

DEC-158 does not supersede DEC-097 through DEC-157. It adds a read-only large external KEP retrofit dogfood fixture for
Kubernetes KEP-753 Sidecar Containers. The fixture maps formal KEP intent from `kubernetes/enhancements` to related
`kubernetes/kubernetes` source/test surfaces, forbidden boundaries, and an instruction-pack-ready record without cloning
or mutating Kubernetes. Focused tests verify `graph retrofit plan` and `graph operation generate-pack` can read the
fixture, preserve edgeIntent coverage, expose forbidden boundaries, and keep external mutation disabled. This does not
run Kubernetes tests, claim maintainer approval, create upstream PRs, enroll Kubernetes in positive validate-all, add
enforcement, or expand source authority.

DEC-159 does not supersede DEC-097 through DEC-158. It expands the Kubernetes KEP-753 retrofit fixture from broad
source/test surfaces to exact KEP section, code symbol, and test anchors. The graph now records symbols such as
`IsRestartableInitContainer`, `computeInitContainerActions`, and `AggregateContainerRequests`, plus unit/e2e test anchors
for restartable init-container behavior. Focused tests verify the expanded anchor map and updated graph counts. This
remains read-only external dogfood Evidence and still does not clone or mutate Kubernetes, run Kubernetes tests, claim
maintainer approval, create upstream PRs, enable enforcement, or expand source authority.

DEC-160 does not supersede DEC-097 through DEC-159. It adds the Compiler Boundary MVP: a compiler-required vs
AI-advisory task registry, an Execution Contract MVP schema, a Todo Search dry-run execution contract fixture, the local
`pbe graph read-model report-compiler-boundary --json` report command, and health/E2E observation of compiler boundary
status. This proves that execution-affecting contract facts can be validated as compiler-owned artifacts before AI
execution. It remains non-enforcing and does not enable required checks, branch protection, automatic AI execution,
acceptance, graph delta application, source-authority expansion, or tree-native retirement.

DEC-161 does not supersede DEC-097 through DEC-160. It hardens the Compiler Boundary MVP as a Contract Fixture Validator:
registry, schema, and dry-run contract issues are bucketed separately; boundary-principle, status, source-mode, scope,
check, Evidence, stop-condition, unknown, risk, and human-decision shapes are validated more strictly; and the current
layer is explicitly separated from a future Actual Contract Compiler. This remains non-enforcing and does not enable
required checks, branch protection, automatic AI execution, graph delta application, acceptance, source-authority
expansion, or tree-native retirement.

DEC-162 does not supersede DEC-097 through DEC-161. It closes the next Compiler Boundary validator gaps: high, critical,
and blocking risks now require a linked accepted or mitigated human decision even when the risk itself claims
`mitigated`; schema field authorities, Evidence freshness, stop-condition actions, human-decision statuses, and
human-decision targets are checked against bounded vocabularies or known ids; and a durable invalid fixture records the
self-mitigated high-risk case. This remains Contract Fixture Validator hardening only and does not create an Actual
Contract Compiler, required check, branch protection rule, automatic AI execution path, acceptance authority, graph delta
application, source-authority expansion, or tree-native retirement.

DEC-163 does not supersede DEC-097 through DEC-162. It adds the Compiler Input Model MVP: a machine-readable schema,
Todo Search dry-run input fixture, and local `graph read-model report-compiler-input --json` command that validate the
input surface a future Actual Contract Compiler may consume. The MVP defines human request, graph snapshot, pack schema,
policy snapshot, evidence index, and target scope candidates as inputs and explicitly blocks compiled contract claims
inside the input fixture. This remains non-executing and does not create an Actual Contract Compiler, required check,
branch protection rule, automatic AI execution path, graph delta application, acceptance authority, source-authority
expansion, or tree-native retirement.

DEC-164 does not supersede DEC-097 through DEC-163. It hardens the Compiler Input Model MVP with cross-reference
validation: graph snapshot and evidence artifact paths must exist, target scope candidate paths must exist,
`graph-source:node:<id>` derivations must resolve to known graph-source node ids, pack schema required groups must use
known input groups, and policy/status/freshness/scope-kind/confidence values must stay within bounded vocabularies. This
remains input validation only and does not create an Actual Contract Compiler, required check, branch protection rule,
automatic AI execution path, graph delta application, acceptance authority, source-authority expansion, or tree-native
retirement.

DEC-165 does not supersede DEC-097 through DEC-164. It adds Contract Compiler Dry-Run v0: a local deterministic compiler
surface that consumes the current validated Compiler Input Model `bug_fix` fixture, writes a candidate
`execution-contract-dry-run.generated.json`, and feeds that candidate back through the Contract Fixture Validator. This
is still non-executing and non-enforcing. It does not execute AI, apply graph deltas, accept work, enable required
checks, configure branch protection, expand source authority, or retire tree-native artifacts.

DEC-166 does not supersede DEC-097 through DEC-165. It hardens Contract Compiler Dry-Run to v0.1: compiler-produced
candidates now use `sourceMode: contract-compiler-dry-run-v0`, unsupported inputs report `contract-candidate-not-run`,
Evidence/check derivation comes from `policySnapshot.evidenceCheckMappings`, forbidden-scope derivation comes from
`policySnapshot.forbiddenScopeRules`, and the compiler writes a generated-vs-hand-written diff report at
`examples/read-model-aggregate/generated/execution-contract-dry-run.diff.json`. This remains dry-run Evidence only and
does not execute AI, apply graph deltas, accept work, enable required checks, configure branch protection, expand source
authority, or retire tree-native artifacts.

DEC-167 does not supersede DEC-097 through DEC-166. It clarifies Contract Compiler Dry-Run review semantics:
`contract-compiler-dry-run-pass` and `contract-candidate-pass` do not imply compiler/hand-written equivalence. Health,
E2E, and the diff artifact now expose `non-blocking-review-diff` and `compiler-equivalence-not-proven` while a diff is
present. The diff report also includes id-based summaries for scopes, checks, and Evidence, and compiler input
validation requires `policy:<id>` forbidden-scope derivations to resolve to known `policySnapshot.policies[].id` values.
Supported-but-uncompilable inputs now report `contract-candidate-blocked`, while unsupported inputs remain
`contract-candidate-not-run`. This remains dry-run review Evidence only and does not execute AI, apply graph deltas,
accept work, enable required checks, configure branch protection, expand source authority, or retire tree-native
artifacts.

DEC-168 does not supersede DEC-097 through DEC-167. It classifies Contract Compiler Dry-Run generated-vs-hand-written
diffs with fixture-specific semantic review metadata: `semanticDiffs[]`, `semanticClassificationCounts`,
`highestReviewSeverity`, and `compilerPromotionReadiness`. Current rules classify missing allowed scope as
`conservative-restriction`, missing forbidden scope as `policy-loss`, extra forbidden scope as `policy-expansion`, extra
checks as `safe-additive`, missing checks or extra Evidence as `evidence-chain-mismatch`, and missing Evidence as
`semantic-loss`. The current Todo Search dry-run remains `compiler-promotion-not-ready` because semantic/policy losses
block promotion readiness. This remains non-enforcing review metadata only and does not execute AI, apply graph deltas,
accept work, enable required checks, configure branch protection, expand source authority, or retire tree-native
artifacts.

DEC-169 does not supersede DEC-097 through DEC-168. It hardens semantic diff classification into an explicit dry-run
v0.1 rule table with `ruleId`, `targetField`, `condition`, `classification`, `reviewSeverity`, `promotionImpact`, and
`reason`. Each `semanticDiffs[]` entry records `matchedRuleId`; unmatched field differences use
`semantic-diff-rule-unknown`, are counted in `semanticDiffRuleCoverage`, and prevent promotion readiness. The
`compilerPromotionReadiness` value is derived from semantic diffs rather than asserted separately. This remains
non-enforcing review metadata only and does not execute AI, apply graph deltas, accept work, enable required checks,
configure branch protection, expand source authority, or retire tree-native artifacts.

DEC-170 does not supersede DEC-097 through DEC-169. It triages Contract Compiler Dry-Run unknown semantic diffs:
`sourceMode` and `nonExecutionStatement` are classified as `metadata-only`, while `requiredContext`, `knownRisks`, and
`stopConditions` are now covered by id-based semantic summaries and explicit rules. The remaining unknown field is
`outputRequirements`, recorded as unclassified review debt in `semanticDiffRuleCoverage.unknownFields`. This remains
non-enforcing review metadata only and does not execute AI, apply graph deltas, accept work, enable required checks,
configure branch protection, expand source authority, or retire tree-native artifacts.

DEC-171 does not supersede DEC-097 through DEC-170. It closes the current Contract Compiler Dry-Run unknown semantic
diff set by classifying `outputRequirements` as `output-requirement-loss`. The generated candidate replaces the
hand-written obligations to report actual git-diff changed files and command-derived Evidence status with compiler
input/candidate/diff status reporting, so output obligations are not equivalent and compiler promotion remains
`compiler-promotion-not-ready`. The current dry-run diff set is fully classified, but this remains non-enforcing review
metadata only and does not execute AI, apply graph deltas, accept work, enable required checks, configure branch
protection, expand source authority, or retire tree-native artifacts.

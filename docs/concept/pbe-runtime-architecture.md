# PBE Runtime Architecture

Status: canonical candidate

## Document Purpose

This document defines the active runtime architecture concept for Project Blueprint Engine before lower-level design work
begins.

PBE runtime architecture describes how Codex, human gates, `.pbe` artifacts, and deterministic CLI gates cooperate. It
does not describe a standalone runtime service.

## Scope

This document covers:

- the active runtime responsibilities
- the source-of-truth chain
- the boundary between planning, execution, review, and revision
- what PBE explicitly is not

This document does not cover TypeScript data models, CLI command design, validators, migration scripts, or detailed
policy implementation.

## Active Runtime Responsibilities

PBE runs through these responsibilities:

| Responsibility           | Role                                                                                                 |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Human judgment gates     | Approve or revise product meaning, UI/UX, scope, architecture runway, review result, and acceptance. |
| Codex skill protocol     | Guides RPD, WPD, VD, ACEP, review, revision, visual work, and stop conditions.                       |
| Durable `.pbe` artifacts | Store Product, Project, Work, Test, Cycle, Change, Impact, Evidence, and Acceptance state.           |
| Deterministic CLI gates  | Validate file-judgable conditions and perform supported state transitions.                           |
| Execution contracts      | Bound what Codex may change and what evidence must be produced in the current cycle.                 |

The old "5 Layer" explanation is not the active architecture. It may be used only as a historical or explanatory frame.

## Source-Of-Truth Chain

The active conceptual chain is:

```text
Product Tree
-> Project Tree
-> Work Tree
-> Test Tree
-> Cycle Tree
-> Cycle Contract
-> Node Execution Contract
-> Evidence Tree
-> Acceptance Tree
```

Change handling uses:

```text
Change Tree -> Impact Tree -> reopened or invalidated nodes -> refreshed evidence -> user review
```

Compatibility views such as `.pbe/blueprint/*` and `.pbe/codex-execution-pack/*` can support older workflows, but they
do not replace the tree-native source artifacts.

## Transition Position

Current operational architecture:

```text
tree-native source artifacts plus skills, contracts, evidence, acceptance, and CLI gates
```

Target architecture:

```text
Maintainability Graph as source model, with Trees and Views projected from it
```

This document describes the current operational architecture and the transition stance. It does not perform source-model
promotion.

In this document, "Product Tree is the source of product truth" describes the current operational architecture. It does
not reject the long-term Graph-source target, and it does not make Maintainability Graph the operational source now.

[runtime-feasibility-demonstration.md](runtime-feasibility-demonstration.md) defines the representative readiness policy
that a future demo must satisfy before Graph-source promotion can be considered. That policy does not change this
document's current operational architecture.

[representative-runtime-feasibility-demo.md](representative-runtime-feasibility-demo.md) selects the recommended slice
for future demo execution. It does not execute the demo or create runtime authority.

[actual-runtime-feasibility-demo-result.md](actual-runtime-feasibility-demo-result.md) records the current manual demo
result for that slice. It is now `demonstrated` for the representative demo slice with retained warnings, while still
preserving source authority. A supplemental compatibility mismatch slice demonstrates a real ACEP task-card-only wording
mismatch as a bounded warning, PP-001 confirmation is recorded for the Todo Search slice, bounded runtime fixture Evidence
is present for title + note/content search, and renewed Acceptance is user-approved. None of this is public-doc cleanup or
source promotion.

[rollback-compatibility-strategy.md](rollback-compatibility-strategy.md) defines the recovery and compatibility safety
policy required before any future promotion review. That policy does not change current source authority or implement
rollback behavior.

[graph-source-promotion-readiness-review.md](graph-source-promotion-readiness-review.md) records the later readiness
review. It now separates the earlier limited pilot recommendation from the refreshed Graph-first Node/Edge/Tag parity
status. The user approved the bounded limited pilot option for the Todo Search selected slice, while full promotion and
broad source authority change remain not approved. It does not promote Maintainability Graph or change current runtime
authority.

Manual Node/Edge/Tag read-model parity artifacts now exist under `examples/internal-legacy/adoption/todo-search-slice/`, so the
readiness recommendation can return to a limited pilot user decision surface. Generated builder or CLI-backed output
remains a later full-promotion/repeatability question rather than current runtime authority.

[limited-pilot-promotion-decision-package.md](limited-pilot-promotion-decision-package.md) is the refreshed user
judgment surface for the limited pilot decision, and
[limited-pilot-transition-record.md](limited-pilot-transition-record.md) records the bounded user-approved option. No
runtime authority changes.

[dry-run-scoped-limited-pilot-observation-record.md](dry-run-scoped-limited-pilot-observation-record.md) records the
user-selected review-only dry-run as `usable-with-warnings`.
[scoped-source-authority-pilot-preparation-package.md](scoped-source-authority-pilot-preparation-package.md) records the
user-approved preparation package and recommends generated builder / CLI-backed read-model output before
authority-bearing scoped execution. It still does not change runtime authority.
[generated-read-model-evidence-requirement.md](generated-read-model-evidence-requirement.md) records that generated /
CLI-backed read-model Evidence is now required before actual scoped execution can be reconsidered. It is a prerequisite
record, not implementation approval and not a runtime authority change.

[graph-node-edge-tag-policy.md](graph-node-edge-tag-policy.md) and
[retrofit-graph-bootstrap.md](retrofit-graph-bootstrap.md) refine the target Graph-first architecture. They do not
change current tree-native runtime authority, CLI behavior, validators, schemas, or generated builder support.

## Runtime Boundaries

PBE is not:

- a GUI product
- a SaaS backend
- a separate OpenAI API provider
- a daemon
- an execution engine that tries to do everything
- a validator that infers product meaning without recorded artifacts

PBE is a requirements-based execution control layer for AI-assisted development.

## Confirmed Decisions

- Product Tree is the source of product truth.
- Tree-native artifacts remain the current operational source artifacts.
- Maintainability Graph is the long-term target source model, pending separate approval.
- Lower trees derive from Product Tree branches.
- Work is executable only through selected or foundation Work nodes.
- Cycle and Node Execution Contracts bound implementation.
- Feedback or drift becomes Change and Impact work before revision.
- Codex submits for review; the user accepts.

## Remaining Open Questions

- Whether Maintainability Graph later gains generated/read-model artifact support.
- Whether View Tree Pack remains a conceptual projection or becomes a concrete artifact pack.
- Which older public docs still need terminology cleanup after this concept baseline is reviewed.
- When and under what review criteria actual scoped limited pilot transition execution should begin.
- Whether the user will accept ACEP task-card public-doc cleanup as deferred cleanup, or require cleanup before
  promotion approval.
- Whether full Graph-source promotion requires an actual generated graph builder or CLI-backed read-model output.
- Which compatibility views must remain maintained after a future promotion.

## Related Gate

This document supports Phase 1-2 architecture alignment. It is not an approval to design CLI behavior, schemas, or
validators.

# Scoped Source-Authority Pilot Preparation Package

Status: scoped-source-authority-pilot-preparation-package / preparation-approved / followed-by-scoped-execution-record

## Document Purpose

This package prepares the next user decision for a possible scoped source-authority pilot in the Todo Search selected
slice.

It answers what would have to be true before source authority can change inside the bounded pilot scope. It does not
execute that change.

Follow-up status: the user later approved actual scoped source-authority pilot execution for the Todo Search selected
slice with generated Evidence. The execution is recorded in
[scoped-source-authority-pilot-execution-record.md](scoped-source-authority-pilot-execution-record.md). This preparation
package remains the prerequisite decision surface and does not become full Graph-source promotion.

This document is not:

- actual scoped source-authority pilot execution
- full Graph-source promotion
- Maintainability Graph promotion to current operational source
- tree-native artifact retirement, deletion, or supersession
- public-doc cleanup
- CLI/schema/runtime/model/validator/generator implementation
- generated graph builder implementation
- rollback command implementation
- Codex/PBE self-approval

## Pilot Preparation Scope

### Primary Scope

```text
examples/internal-legacy/adoption/todo-search-slice
```

The preparation package applies only to the Todo Search representative demo-support slice.

### Supplemental Evidence Only

```text
examples/internal-legacy/adoption/compatibility-mismatch-slice
```

The compatibility mismatch slice remains supporting Evidence for compatibility warning handling. It is not pilot source
scope.

### Explicit Non-Scope

This package does not include:

- full PBE source transition
- full Graph-source promotion
- public-doc cleanup
- CLI/schema/runtime/model/validator/generator implementation
- generated graph builder implementation
- migration or rollback command implementation
- tree-native artifact retirement
- full Todo app implementation

## Candidate Source Authority Boundary

### Current Boundary

Current state remains unchanged:

- Tree-native selected-slice artifacts are the current operational source.
- The manual Maintainability Graph read-model is read/alignment Evidence.
- The View Instance Manifest is projection Evidence.
- Compatibility mismatch supplemental records are warning Evidence, not pilot source scope.
- Demo-support Acceptance is user-approved with warnings, but it is not source-transition approval.

### Candidate Boundary For Future Scoped Pilot Execution

A future scoped source-authority pilot could define a candidate boundary only inside
`examples/internal-legacy/adoption/todo-search-slice`.

Two possible candidate standards remain:

| Candidate standard                                       | Meaning                                                                                                                    | Risk / consequence                                                                                                  |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Manual read-model as temporary pilot authority candidate | Treat `maintainability-graph-read-model.*` and `view-instance-manifest.*` as the scoped candidate source for pilot review. | Faster learning, but higher authority-confusion risk because no generator/CLI-backed repeatability exists.          |
| Generated builder / CLI-backed read-model required first | Keep manual artifacts as preparation Evidence only until repeatable generated output exists.                               | Slower, but safer for authority transition because the source/fallback/parity boundary can be mechanically checked. |

Preparation finding in this package:

```text
requires-generated-builder-first
```

The user selected that prerequisite after this package. The generated read-model Evidence requirement is recorded in
[generated-read-model-evidence-requirement.md](generated-read-model-evidence-requirement.md). It is a requirement record
that led to bounded Todo Search generated output. The output is Evidence only and does not approve actual scoped
source-authority execution.

Reason:

- The dry-run result is `usable-with-warnings`, so the workflow is reviewable.
- Actual scoped source authority execution is stronger than review-only dry-run.
- Manual parity is acceptable as preparation Evidence, but it is not repeatable enough to be the default temporary
  authority candidate without an explicit user risk decision.
- Generated builder / CLI-backed output is the safer prerequisite before any authority-bearing execution.

If the user explicitly accepts the manual authority-candidate risk, the package can support a later
`Approve actual scoped source-authority pilot execution with warnings` decision. That would still require a separate
Approval Brief, source boundary, fallback rule, and rollback/fallback gate.

| ------------------------------------- | --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Runtime fixture command Evidence      | present / fresh | `npx vitest run examples/internal-legacy/adoption/todo-search-slice/runtime-fixture` passes 1 file/6 tests. |
| Node/Edge/Tag parity                  | present         | Manual read-model separates `nodeKind`, `edgeType`, and allowed `viewScopedTags`.                           |
| 7 Core View coverage                  | present         | Intent, Behavior, Structure, Scope/Execution, Impact, Verification, Evidence/Acceptance.                    |
| Check/Evidence separation             | visible         | Checks and Evidence are separated through Test/Evidence artifacts and read-model edges.                     |
| Retained warnings                     | visible         | Bounded fixture, UI visual partial, validator/CI repeatability open, public-doc cleanup deferred.           |
| Generated builder / CLI-backed output | present         | Bounded Todo Search generated output exists; execution approval remains separate.                           |

### Authority Gate

Before actual scoped execution, PBE needs:

- exact scoped source boundary
- affected artifact list
- source/fallback precedence rule
- conflict rule between graph read-model and tree-native artifacts
- status labels for graph candidate, tree fallback, and compatibility views
- explicit rule that Acceptance Tree/user acceptance authority is not replaced

Preparation recommendation:

```text
Do not activate a graph/manual read-model source candidate until the user either requires generated output first or
explicitly accepts manual-candidate risk for a bounded pilot.
```

### Rollback / Fallback Gate

Before actual scoped execution, PBE needs:

- tree-native selected-slice snapshot/reference preserved
- fallback trigger categories
- rollback-not-needed condition for review-only mode
- rollback-ready condition for authority-bearing execution
- no silent rollback/fallback
- user-visible rollback/fallback decision surface

Current status:

```text
rollback-not-needed for preparation; rollback-ready not yet established for authority execution
```

### Compatibility Gate

Before actual scoped execution, PBE needs:

- ACEP task-card public-doc cleanup status explicitly accepted or required
- compatibility mismatch retained as visible warning if cleanup remains deferred
- compatibility view marking so supplemental evidence cannot become pilot source silently
- Control Node treatment for cleanup warning

Current status:

```text
compatibility warning visible; cleanup deferred; user decision still needed if cleanup should block execution
```

### Approval Gate

Before actual scoped execution:

- user approval is required
- Codex/PBE cannot self-approve
- demo-support Acceptance is not source-transition approval
- Approval Brief or equivalent user judgment surface must show Evidence, warnings, fallback, compatibility, and
  authority boundaries

Current status:

```text
preparation approved; execution not approved
```

## Preparation Finding

```text
requires-generated-builder-first
```

This is conservative. The dry-run demonstrates that manual artifacts are useful for review, but actual scoped source
authority execution should not default to manual parity as an active candidate source without either:

1. generated builder / CLI-backed read-model output, or
2. a separate user decision accepting manual-candidate risk for this bounded pilot.

## Recommended Next User Decision Surface

After this package, the user should choose one of:

1. `Approve actual scoped source-authority pilot execution with warnings`
2. `Require generated builder / CLI-backed read-model before execution`
3. `Require public-doc cleanup before execution`
4. `Strengthen evidence / run another dry-run`
5. `Defer scoped source-authority pilot`
6. `Reject scoped source-authority pilot`

Recommended option:

```text
Require generated builder / CLI-backed read-model before execution
```

Reason:

- It preserves the dry-run learning while reducing source-authority confusion.
- It gives the future execution approval a repeatable parity artifact instead of a manual-only candidate.
- It makes conflict/fallback checks more reviewable before any authority boundary changes.

If the user values a faster bounded pilot more than repeatability, option 1 can still be presented as a risk-accepted
choice, but it must be explicit.

## Approval Brief Draft

### Intent Understood

PBE is preparing the decision surface for a possible scoped source-authority pilot inside the Todo Search selected slice.

### Result Summary

The preparation package identifies current source authority, possible candidate authority, fallback/reference roles,
Evidence gates, rollback/fallback gates, compatibility gates, and user approval gates. It recommends generated builder /
CLI-backed read-model output before authority-bearing execution.

### Verification Summary

| Actual scoped authority execution approval | resolved         | User approved bounded Todo Search scoped pilot execution; see the execution record.                   |

### Remaining Judgment

The user selected generated builder / CLI-backed read-model Evidence as a prerequisite, selected design-first work, and
approved the bounded implementation task. Generated Evidence now exists for Todo Search, and the user approved the
bounded scoped pilot execution. The scoped pilot review now passes with retained warnings. The next judgment is whether
to keep observing the pilot, require validator/CI backing before broader use, require cleanup first, prepare broader
promotion review, or rollback/defer.

### Approval Choice Candidates

- `Keep scoped pilot active and observe longer`
- `Require validator/CI-backed read-model Evidence before execution`
- `Require public-doc cleanup before execution`
- `Prepare broader Graph-source promotion review`
- `Rollback / defer scoped source-authority pilot`

### State Label

```text
Decision required
```

Reason: preparation, output design, bounded generated Evidence, scoped pilot execution, and scoped pilot review are
recorded, but next-phase observation length, broader use, cleanup, validator/CI backing, and broader promotion remain
unapproved.

| Evidence Reality Gate                   | PASS   | Evidence points to reviewable artifacts, command Evidence, parity records, and visible warnings.       |
| Rollback / Fallback Gate                | PASS   | Rollback is not needed for preparation; execution needs fallback conditions before approval.           |
| Compatibility Gate                      | PASS   | ACEP cleanup remains deferred and visible; supplemental compatibility slice is not pilot source scope. |
| User Approval Gate                      | PASS   | Actual scoped execution requires a future explicit user decision.                                      |
| Implementation Boundary Gate            | PASS   | No CLI, schema, runtime, validator, generator, migration, rollback, or cleanup is implemented.         |

## Final Non-Execution Statement

This package does not execute scoped source-authority transition.

It does not promote Maintainability Graph, does not change current operational source, does not retire tree-native
artifacts, and does not approve full Graph-source promotion.

The next step requires an explicit user decision.

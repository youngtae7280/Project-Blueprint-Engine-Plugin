# Source-Authority Expansion Design Package

Status: design-package / docs-only / no-source-authority-change / no-promotion

## Purpose

This package defines the candidate source-authority expansion shape that would need review before any broader
Graph-source promotion decision.

It does not execute a source authority change. It does not promote Maintainability Graph, retire tree-native artifacts,
change workflow behavior, change CLI behavior, add enforcement, or replace user acceptance. It only names the artifact
roles, authority boundaries, staged expansion path, and caveats that a future promotion decision package must make
explicit.

## Current Authority Baseline

Current operational source authority remains unchanged:

| Area                                         | Current role                                                                                                                                       |
| -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Product / Project / Work Trees               | Operational source for product meaning, project structure, executable work scope, selected/foundation/deferred/out-of-scope classification.        |
| Test / Evidence / Acceptance Trees           | Operational source for verification obligations, Evidence records, freshness/exception state, and user-controlled acceptance.                      |
| Cycle Contract / Node Execution Contracts    | Current bounded execution authority for selected/foundation scope and required Evidence.                                                           |
| Todo Search generated read-model             | Bounded scoped-pilot Evidence and parity/validation surface only; not repository-wide source authority.                                            |
| Todo App PBE Run generated read-model        | Structure-only Evidence over a canonical `.pbe` fixture; not parity-backed, pilot-marker-backed, or source-authority-bearing.                      |
| Read-model parity / validation / aggregate   | Evidence and review signals only. They do not approve source authority expansion, enforcement, promotion, or user acceptance.                      |
| CI evidence manifest and PR informational CI | Non-enforcing Evidence only. They do not create required checks, branch protection, enforcement, or source authority consequences.                 |
| Public docs and concept docs                 | Public explanation and concept records. They do not become product source authority or promotion approval by describing candidate future behavior. |

Current state:

current tree-native source
```

Current non-state:

graph-source promoted
```

## Candidate Future Authority Roles

A future promotion decision should classify every artifact family into one of these roles:

| Role                                         | Meaning                                                                                                                                        |
| -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| source authority                             | The artifact/model treated as operational source for a defined scope after explicit user approval.                                             |
| projection / read model                      | A derived or aligned view used for inspection, validation, planning, or traceability, but not source by itself.                                |
| compatibility view                           | A maintained bridge or legacy-readable artifact retained for transition, review continuity, external users, or rollback reference.             |
| fallback / reference                         | A retained source or snapshot used when a candidate transition is rejected, deferred, rolled back, or needs comparison.                        |
| generated Evidence                           | Report, manifest, parity result, validation result, CI artifact, or aggregate summary used to support review, not authority or acceptance.     |
| retired / deprecated after explicit approval | Artifact or wording class intentionally removed from active use only after explicit user approval and satisfied compatibility/rollback checks. |

## Candidate Authority Matrix

This matrix is a design surface for review. It is not an approved promotion matrix.

| Artifact family                           | Current role                                      | Candidate broader role after explicit approval                                      | Required boundary before any change                                                                                       |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Product Tree                              | source authority                                  | graph source record or maintained projection from graph source                      | Product meaning, acceptance criteria, UX decisions, and non-scope must remain traceable and user-controlled.              |
| Project Tree                              | source authority derived from Product Tree        | graph source records or maintained architecture projection                          | Ownership, boundaries, surfaces, and dependencies must retain parity and conflict handling.                               |
| Work Tree                                 | source authority for executable work scope        | graph source records or maintained Work View projection                             | Selected/foundation/deferred/blocked/out-of-scope scope must not silently change.                                         |
| Test Tree                                 | source authority for verification obligations     | graph source records or maintained Test View projection                             | Checks and acceptance-criteria coverage must remain explicit.                                                             |
| Evidence Tree                             | source authority for Evidence records             | graph source records or maintained Evidence View projection                         | Evidence status, freshness, exception, and linked Check scope must not be hidden.                                         |
| Acceptance Tree                           | source authority for user-controlled acceptance   | graph source records or maintained Acceptance View projection                       | User acceptance authority must remain user-controlled and cannot be replaced by generated or CI Evidence.                 |
| Maintainability Graph                     | canonical read/alignment model and source target  | candidate source model only after explicit promotion approval                       | Promotion package must define exact scope, conflict handling, rollback/fallback, compatibility period, and user approval. |
| Generated read-model                      | generated Evidence                                | projection/read model or source-derived generated view after approved promotion     | Generated output must remain freshness-scoped and cannot silently override source records.                                |
| View Instance Manifest                    | review Evidence for Core View coverage            | projection manifest or compatibility review aid                                     | View membership and role tags must remain separate from source facts.                                                     |
| Read-model parity / validation reports    | generated Evidence                                | Evidence for parity, policy compliance, and source/projection drift                 | Pass status is not acceptance, promotion, or enforcement by itself.                                                       |
| Aggregate read-model summary              | Evidence-only cross-slice summary                 | Evidence-only summary unless a later enforcement policy is explicitly approved      | Aggregate pass remains non-promotional and must keep per-slice warnings visible.                                          |
| CI evidence manifest                      | non-enforcing CI Evidence                         | Evidence for repeatability; possible future required signal only after approval     | Required checks, branch protection, and enforcement need separate user decision.                                          |
| ACEP execution pack                       | compatibility package over contracts and evidence | compatibility/execution package or generated projection after approved promotion    | ACEP must remain Cycle Contract / Node Execution Contract packaging, not standalone source authority.                     |
| Task-card views                           | compatibility/execution views                     | compatibility/execution views or generated projections from approved source records | Task cards must remain views/carriers of contract obligations, not source authority.                                      |
| Cycle Contract / Node Execution Contracts | execution authority for bounded scope             | execution authority remains required regardless of source model                     | Source change must not authorize silent scope expansion or missing Evidence.                                              |
| Public docs                               | user-facing explanation                           | explanation of current and future states                                            | Must not claim promotion before approval or hide compatibility/public-doc cleanup caveats.                                |
| Concept docs                              | concept records and decision history              | concept records and decision history                                                | Historical decisions remain visible; concept docs are not themselves operational source authority.                        |

## Proposed Staged Expansion Path

1. Keep the current bounded Todo Search scoped pilot active under observation.
2. Define broader candidate source boundaries using the matrix above, including explicit source/projection/fallback roles.
3. Prepare a concrete rollback/fallback plan for the broader candidate scope, including trigger categories, precedence,
   snapshots, recovery paths, and compatibility-retirement conditions.
4. Prepare a promotion decision package that shows Evidence, warnings, conflicts, public-doc cleanup status, enforcement
   status, and user approval choices.
5. Only after explicit user approval, execute a scoped or broader authority change with source, projection, fallback,
   compatibility, and Evidence obligations named.

## Risks And Caveats

| Risk / caveat                            | Required handling before promotion                                                                                       |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Tree-native vs graph/read-model conflict | Define conflict classification, source precedence, review path, and when user judgment is required.                      |
| Stale generated Evidence                 | Keep freshness/sourceCommit visible and block hidden promotion from stale reports.                                       |
| Compatibility view confusion             | Label compatibility views, task-card views, generated read-models, and public docs as non-authoritative unless approved. |
| Acceptance/user approval boundary        | Preserve Acceptance Tree and user approval as user-controlled; CI/generation cannot self-accept.                         |
| Rollback/fallback requirements           | Define snapshots, fallback precedence, rollback triggers, and compatibility-retirement conditions before execution.      |
| Todo App PBE Run structure-only status   | Do not treat the second profile as source-authority-bearing without separate parity/pilot/authority artifacts.           |
| Invalid fixture local-only policy        | Keep negative fixtures local-only unless a separate CI invalid-fixture mode is approved.                                 |
| Enforcement ambiguity                    | Keep CI informational/non-enforcing unless required checks and branch protection are explicitly approved.                |
| Public-doc cleanup or waiver             | Batch A/B/C/D cleanup is reviewable, but waiver or sufficiency still needs explicit promotion-decision treatment.        |

## Non-Scope

This package does not:

- expand source authority
- approve Graph-source promotion
- retire tree-native artifacts
- migrate artifacts
- modify public docs
- modify workflow, code, CLI, tests, or generated artifacts
- create a PR or dispatch GitHub Actions
- add required checks, branch protection, or enforcement
- add invalid fixtures to CI
- promote Todo App PBE Run beyond `structure-only`
- replace user acceptance authority

## Recommended Next Decision Surface

Recommended next step:

```text
Prepare concrete rollback/fallback plan for the candidate broader authority scope.
```

Rationale:

- public-doc cleanup batches A/B/C/D are now mostly addressed as review inputs
- the candidate authority matrix is now explicit
- actual promotion still needs rollback/fallback mechanics and user approval boundaries before an approval package can
  be safely assembled

| Result type                    | Manual Evidence pack and review result, not generated artifact design |

This result is not Graph-source promotion. It does not change source authority, promote Maintainability Graph to current
source, retire tree-native artifacts, implement PBE runtime behavior, define schemas, implement validators, or create
migration/rollback mechanics.

Tree-native artifacts remain the current operational source of truth until a later explicit promotion decision receives
user approval. The subsequent readiness review is a review artifact, not promotion approval.

## 2. Selected Slice Summary

Selected representative slice:

```text
Todo Search Adoption + Product Meaning Feedback
```

Original selected scope:

- title-only Todo search

Confirmed revision scope after PP-001:

- title + note/content Todo search
- confirmation source: user approved PP-001 in parent orchestration chat on 2026-06-24
- selected Product node: `PT-SEARCH-001`
- selected Project nodes: `PJ-TODO-LIST-SURFACE`, `PJ-TODO-SEARCH-HELPER`
- selected Work node: `WT-SEARCH-001`
- selected Tests: `TT-SEARCH-001`, `TT-SEARCH-002`, `TT-SEARCH-003`, `TT-SEARCH-004`
- selected Evidence: `EV-SEARCH-TEST`, `EV-SEARCH-REVIEW`, `EV-SEARCH-NOTE-TEST`
- accepted title-only slice: `AT-ROOT`

Observed deferred / non-scope examples:

- tag filter
- date filter
- fuzzy search
- server-side search
- saved search
- note/description search until Product Patch feedback

Confirmed product meaning feedback:

```text
Search should include todo note content.
```

Observed stale/reopen state after confirmation:

- `product-patch-tree.json` confirms expanding the search target from title-only to title + note/content.
- The patch is `confirmed_revision_required`, `requiresUserConfirmation: true`, and `userConfirmed: true`.
- `change-tree.json` records that feedback as `CH-001` with the Decision Control Node resolved.
- `impact-tree.json` classifies affected selected-slice nodes as refreshed, partial, or accepted with retained warnings.
- Bounded runtime fixture Evidence is present for title + note/content behavior.
- Renewed Acceptance is user-approved with retained warnings.

Supplemental compatibility slice:

```text
ACEP task-card-only authority wording
```

This supplemental slice is used only for the compatibility mismatch path. It does not change the selected Todo Search
product slice, does not clean up public docs, and does not change source authority.

## 3. Demo Source Discovery

Source discovery used observable repository files and command output only.

| Observation                           | Evidence                                                                                                                                                            | Status  |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| Current source before runtime fixture | `git log -1 --oneline` returned `33bab9c Record PP-001 confirmation evidence`.                                                                                      | present |
| Root `.pbe` folder                    | `Test-Path .pbe` returned no root `.pbe` directory in this repository checkout.                                                                                     | present |
| Original slice artifact list          | `examples/internal-legacy/adoption/todo-search-slice` contained Product, Work, Test, Evidence, Acceptance, Product Patch, README, and RPD summary snapshots.        | present |
| Strengthened artifact list            | Prior updates added Project Tree, Cycle Contract, Node Execution Contract, Change Tree, Impact Tree, Compatibility Review, Approval Brief, and Evidence Exceptions. | present |
| Supplemental compatibility artifacts  | `examples/internal-legacy/adoption/compatibility-mismatch-slice` records a real ACEP task-card-only wording mismatch and applies compatibility policy.              | present |
| Runtime fixture command               | `npx vitest run examples/internal-legacy/adoption/todo-search-slice/runtime-fixture` passed 1 file and 6 tests.                                                     | present |
| Source-authority boundary             | New files are marked `demo_support_snapshot`, non-authoritative, or demo-support evidence snapshots.                                                                | present |

Because the repo root has no `.pbe` directory, this demo result does not claim a live project `.pbe` run. It records a
manual feasibility review over public docs, illustrative adoption snapshots, and selected-slice demo-support artifacts.

| Happy path                   | Selected Product branch traces through Project, Work, Test, Evidence, Approval Brief, and Acceptance.                                       | Product, Project, Work, Cycle/Node Contract, Test, Evidence, Acceptance, and Approval Brief support artifacts exist.                                                                                   | demonstrated       | Demo-support artifacts are manual; a future generated/runtime run could strengthen repeatability.     |
| Stale evidence / reopen path | Post-acceptance feedback causes affected nodes to become stale, invalidated, reopened, or refreshed.                                        | Confirmed `PP-001`, Change Tree, Impact Tree, `EV-SEARCH-NOTE-TEST`, and renewed Acceptance approval show decision resolved, runtime Evidence refreshed, and Acceptance closed with retained warnings. | demonstrated       | Screenshot/generated graph/public-doc cleanup warnings remain for readiness review.                   |
| Decision required path       | User judgment is required for scope, Product Patch confirmation, risk acceptance, or evidence exception.                                    | `PP-001` confirmation and renewed Acceptance approval resolve the Product meaning and representative acceptance judgments.                                                                             | demonstrated       | Further promotion readiness judgment remains separate.                                                |
| Evidence exception path      | Missing, stale, partial, or exception Evidence is visible and not treated as proof.                                                         | `evidence-exceptions.md` records resolved note/content command Evidence plus screenshot, compatibility, and generated graph limitations.                                                               | demonstrated       | Exceptions still need later remedy if they become promotion-blocking.                                 |
| Compatibility mismatch path  | Legacy/canonical mismatch is interpreted through Legacy Compatibility Map and becomes Control Node candidate only when it affects judgment. | Supplemental compatibility slice records a real ACEP task-card-only mismatch and candidate `CCN-ACEP-TASK-CARD-AUTHORITY-001`.                                                                         | demonstrated       | Public-doc cleanup remains deferred; this is supplemental evidence, not Todo Search product behavior. |
| Scope boundary path          | Out-of-contract discovery or forbidden scope does not silently expand selected work.                                                        | README, Work Tree, Cycle Contract, and Node Execution Contract now bound the approved title + note/content revision scope.                                                                             | demonstrated       | Tag/date/fuzzy/server/saved search remain out of scope.                                               |

### Why This Does Not Change Source Authority

- The interpretation is manual and read-only.
- New artifacts are marked as demo-support snapshots, not operational source.
- No source file was rewritten to a graph model.
- No tree-native artifact was marked superseded.
- No projection, graph file, validator, CLI command, or runtime source model was created.
- Remaining gaps are recorded as warnings, not inferred into acceptance closure or source promotion.

AI self-report is not Evidence in this result. Feasibility status is based only on observable source files, command
outputs, linked records, demo-support artifacts, and explicit gap records.

## 10. Approval Brief Draft Summary

The demo-support Approval Brief is now recorded at:

```text
examples/internal-legacy/adoption/todo-search-slice/approval-brief.md
```

Post-review outcome:

```text
Accepted with warnings
```

Reason:

- selected-slice evidence is materially stronger
- Product Patch `PP-001` confirmation is present
- stale/reopen tracking is materially stronger
- refreshed note/content runtime Evidence is present/fresh from a bounded fixture
- renewed Acceptance is user-approved with retained warnings
- compatibility mismatch path is now exercised by a supplemental real mismatch and bounded by policy
- public-doc cleanup for that mismatch remains deferred
- historical product command output, screenshot evidence, generated graph output, and public-doc cleanup remain exceptions or warnings

The brief records user-approved renewed Acceptance for the representative demo-support slice. It does not promote
Maintainability Graph.

## 11. Control Node Review

No runtime Control Node artifact is created by this result. The following are visible candidates:

| Candidate                            | Evidence                                                                                                                          | Suggested status              |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Decision Control Node candidate      | `PP-001`, `change-tree.json`, `approval-brief.md` record user confirmation before changing Product meaning.                       | Resolved                      |
| Evidence Control Node candidate      | `evidence-exceptions.md` records resolved fixture Evidence and remaining partial/exception Evidence limits.                       | Resolved with warnings        |
| Impact Control Node candidate        | `impact-tree.json` classifies affected nodes for confirmed `PP-001`, refreshed fixture Evidence, and renewed Acceptance approval. | Closed with retained warnings |
| Compatibility Control Node candidate | Supplemental `CCN-ACEP-TASK-CARD-AUTHORITY-001` records ACEP task-card-only authority wording as a bounded mismatch.              | Active / Review with warning  |
| Acceptance Control Node candidate    | `acceptance-tree.json` and `impact-tree.json` record `AT-ROOT` renewed Acceptance approval with retained warnings.                | Closed with retained warnings |

## 12. Rollback / Compatibility Readiness Note

Concept labels only:

| Label                      | Scoped meaning for this demo                                                                                                                                                    |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `rollback-not-needed`      | No source authority was changed during this demo result. No rollback action is needed for this document.                                                                        |
| `compatibility-maintained` | Legacy/compatibility terms remain mapped through Legacy Compatibility Map; no compatibility artifact was retired.                                                               |
| `rollback-blocked`         | Any future promotion/rollback readiness claim still needs authority/projection strategy, generated/parity expectations, user approval, and explicit warning/exception judgment. |

No rollback, fallback, retirement, migration, or source-authority action was performed.

## 13. Final Feasibility Judgment

Overall demo status:

```text
demonstrated
```

Strengthened from prior result:

- Product -> Project -> Work trace is now reviewable.
- Cycle and Node Execution Contract boundaries are now reviewable.
- Change and Impact evidence are now present as selected-slice support artifacts.
- Evidence exceptions are explicit rather than implicit.
- Approval Brief surface is now present as a support artifact.
- Product Patch `PP-001` confirmation is now recorded with user approval source.
- Affected Work/Test/Evidence/Acceptance snapshots are refreshed, partial, or accepted with retained warnings as appropriate.
- `EV-SEARCH-NOTE-TEST` is now present/fresh from a bounded runtime fixture.
- Todo Search selected-slice compatibility review remains honest: no real mismatch is faked inside that slice.
- Supplemental compatibility mismatch path is now demonstrated with real ACEP task-card-only wording and a Control Node
  candidate.

Remaining blockers / gaps:

1. The runtime fixture is bounded representative Evidence, not a full Todo app implementation.
2. UI screenshot/manual visual evidence for no-result empty state remains partial.
3. Public-doc cleanup for the observed ACEP task-card-only mismatch remains deferred.
4. Historical product command output and generated graph/read-model output remain explicit exceptions.
5. New artifacts are manual demo-support snapshots, not CLI-generated runtime artifacts.

Promotion readiness note:

```text
Graph-source promotion readiness review is recorded separately in graph-source-promotion-readiness-review.md. It is not
Graph-source promotion and must not change source authority without explicit user approval.
```

That readiness review now classifies:

1. manual equivalent read-model parity output as sufficient for limited pilot decision preparation,
2. bounded fixture Evidence and partial UI Evidence as acceptable warnings for readiness discussion,
3. generated builder output as a later full-promotion/repeatability question, and
4. ACEP task-card public-doc cleanup as deferred cleanup.

The manual parity artifacts preserve this demo result's non-promotion boundary and leave explicit user promotion
approval as a separate future decision.

Subsequent Graph-first refinement in [graph-node-edge-tag-policy.md](graph-node-edge-tag-policy.md) does not invalidate
this demo Evidence. The Todo Search read-model parity artifact has since been refreshed under the Node/Edge/Tag taxonomy
for limited pilot review, while limited pilot approval and Graph-source promotion remain separate user decisions.

## 14. Explicit Non-Promotion Statement

This demo result is not Graph-source promotion.

This demo result does not change source authority.

This demo result does not make Maintainability Graph the current operational source.

This demo result does not supersede Product, Project, Work, Test, Evidence, or Acceptance Trees.

The separate promotion readiness review is still not promotion approval. Until a user explicitly approves a source
promotion decision, tree-native artifacts remain the operational source of truth.

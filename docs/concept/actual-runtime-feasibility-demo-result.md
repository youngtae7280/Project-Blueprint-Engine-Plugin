This result is not Graph-source promotion. It does not change source authority, promote Maintainability Graph to current
source, retire tree-native artifacts, implement runtime behavior, define schemas, implement validators, or create
migration/rollback mechanics.

Tree-native artifacts remain the current operational source of truth until a later promotion readiness review and
explicit user approval.

## 2. Selected Slice Summary

Selected representative slice:

```text
Todo Search Adoption + Product Meaning Feedback
```

Observed selected scope:

- title-only Todo search
- selected Product node: `PT-SEARCH-001`
- selected Project nodes: `PJ-TODO-LIST-SURFACE`, `PJ-TODO-SEARCH-HELPER`
- selected Work node: `WT-SEARCH-001`
- selected Tests: `TT-SEARCH-001`, `TT-SEARCH-002`, `TT-SEARCH-003`
- selected Evidence: `EV-SEARCH-TEST`, `EV-SEARCH-REVIEW`
- accepted title-only slice: `AT-ROOT`

Observed deferred / non-scope examples:

- tag filter
- date filter
- fuzzy search
- server-side search
- saved search
- note/description search until Product Patch feedback

Observed product meaning feedback:

```text
Search should include todo note content.
```

Observed stale/reopen pressure:

- `product-patch-tree.json` proposes expanding the search target from title-only to title + note.
- The patch is `proposed`, `requiresUserConfirmation: true`, and `userConfirmed: false`.
- `change-tree.json` records that feedback as `CH-001`.
- `impact-tree.json` classifies affected selected-slice nodes for the proposed meaning shift.
- Product Patch apply is still not performed; revised implementation, refreshed Evidence, and renewed Acceptance are not
  demonstrated.

Supplemental compatibility slice:

```text
ACEP task-card-only authority wording
```

This supplemental slice is used only for the compatibility mismatch path. It does not change the selected Todo Search
product slice, does not clean up public docs, and does not change source authority.

## 3. Demo Source Discovery

Source discovery used observable repository files and command output only.

| Observation                          | Evidence                                                                                                                                                         | Status  |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| Current source before strengthening  | `git log -1 --oneline` returned `88e8f4b Record representative runtime feasibility demo result`.                                                                 | present |
| Root `.pbe` folder                   | `Test-Path .pbe` returned no root `.pbe` directory in this repository checkout.                                                                                  | present |
| Original slice artifact list         | `examples/adoption/todo-search-slice` contained Product, Work, Test, Evidence, Acceptance, Product Patch, README, and RPD summary snapshots.                     | present |
| Strengthened artifact list           | This update adds Project Tree, Cycle Contract, Node Execution Contract, Change Tree, Impact Tree, Compatibility Review, Approval Brief, and Evidence Exceptions. | present |
| Supplemental compatibility artifacts | `examples/adoption/compatibility-mismatch-slice` records a real ACEP task-card-only wording mismatch and applies compatibility policy.                           | present |
| Source-authority boundary            | New files are marked `demo_support_snapshot`, non-authoritative, or demo-support evidence snapshots.                                                             | present |

Because the repo root has no `.pbe` directory, this demo result does not claim a live project `.pbe` run. It records a
manual feasibility review over public docs, illustrative adoption snapshots, and selected-slice demo-support artifacts.

| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Happy path                   | Selected Product branch traces through Project, Work, Test, Evidence, Approval Brief, and Acceptance.                                       | Product, Project, Work, Cycle/Node Contract, Test, Evidence, Acceptance, and Approval Brief support artifacts exist.           | demonstrated           | Demo-support artifacts are manual; a future generated/runtime run could strengthen repeatability.     |
| Stale evidence / reopen path | Post-acceptance feedback causes affected nodes to become stale, invalidated, reopened, or refreshed.                                        | Product Patch, Change Tree, and Impact Tree show conditional stale/reopen pressure.                                            | partially demonstrated | `PP-001` is not user-confirmed; refreshed tests/evidence and renewed acceptance are not demonstrated. |
| Decision required path       | User judgment is required for scope, Product Patch confirmation, risk acceptance, or evidence exception.                                    | `PP-001`, `change-tree.json`, `impact-tree.json`, and `approval-brief.md` show user confirmation is required.                  | demonstrated           | Actual user confirmation remains outside this evidence-strengthening task.                            |
| Evidence exception path      | Missing, stale, partial, or exception Evidence is visible and not treated as proof.                                                         | `evidence-exceptions.md` records fresh command, screenshot, freshness, compatibility, and generated graph limitations.         | demonstrated           | Exceptions still need later remedy if they become promotion-blocking.                                 |
| Compatibility mismatch path  | Legacy/canonical mismatch is interpreted through Legacy Compatibility Map and becomes Control Node candidate only when it affects judgment. | Supplemental compatibility slice records a real ACEP task-card-only mismatch and candidate `CCN-ACEP-TASK-CARD-AUTHORITY-001`. | demonstrated           | Public-doc cleanup remains deferred; this is supplemental evidence, not Todo Search product behavior. |
| Scope boundary path          | Out-of-contract discovery or forbidden scope does not silently expand selected work.                                                        | README, Work Tree, Cycle Contract, and Node Execution Contract show deferred/non-scope and forbidden files.                    | demonstrated           | Product Patch confirmation would require bounded revision before note search enters scope.            |

### Why This Does Not Change Source Authority

- The interpretation is manual and read-only.
- New artifacts are marked as demo-support snapshots, not operational source.
- No source file was rewritten to a graph model.
- No tree-native artifact was marked superseded.
- No projection, graph file, validator, CLI command, or runtime source model was created.
- Remaining gaps are recorded as warnings, not inferred into `demonstrated` status.

AI self-report is not Evidence in this result. Feasibility status is based only on observable source files, command
outputs, linked records, demo-support artifacts, and explicit gap records.

## 10. Approval Brief Draft Summary

The demo-support Approval Brief is now recorded at:

```text
examples/adoption/todo-search-slice/approval-brief.md
```

Draft state label:

```text
Review with warning
```

Reason:

- selected-slice evidence is materially stronger
- Product Patch `PP-001` still requires user confirmation
- stale/reopen closure is not complete
- compatibility mismatch path is now exercised by a supplemental real mismatch and bounded by policy
- public-doc cleanup for that mismatch remains deferred
- fresh product test command output, screenshot evidence, and generated graph output remain exceptions

The brief does not accept product results, mutate Acceptance Tree, apply Product Patch, or promote Maintainability Graph.

## 11. Control Node Review

No runtime Control Node artifact is created by this result. The following are visible candidates:

| Candidate                            | Evidence                                                                                                             | Suggested status                    |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Decision Control Node candidate      | `PP-001`, `change-tree.json`, `approval-brief.md` require user confirmation before changing Product meaning.         | Waiting for human                   |
| Evidence Control Node candidate      | `evidence-exceptions.md` records stale/partial/exception Evidence limits.                                            | Active / Review with warning        |
| Impact Control Node candidate        | `impact-tree.json` classifies affected nodes for `PP-001`.                                                           | Active until Product Patch decision |
| Compatibility Control Node candidate | Supplemental `CCN-ACEP-TASK-CARD-AUTHORITY-001` records ACEP task-card-only authority wording as a bounded mismatch. | Active / Review with warning        |
| Acceptance Control Node candidate    | `impact-tree.json` says `AT-ROOT` would reopen if `PP-001` is confirmed and applied.                                 | Conditional                         |

## 12. Rollback / Compatibility Readiness Note

Concept labels only:

| Label                      | Scoped meaning for this demo                                                                                                                                                       |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `rollback-not-needed`      | No source authority was changed during this demo result. No rollback action is needed for this document.                                                                           |
| `compatibility-maintained` | Legacy/compatibility terms remain mapped through Legacy Compatibility Map; no compatibility artifact was retired.                                                                  |
| `rollback-blocked`         | Any future promotion/rollback readiness claim still needs authority/projection strategy, generated/parity expectations, user approval, and unresolved evidence exception handling. |

No rollback, fallback, retirement, migration, or source-authority action was performed.

## 13. Final Feasibility Judgment

Overall demo status:

```text
partially demonstrated
```

Strengthened from prior result:

- Product -> Project -> Work trace is now reviewable.
- Cycle and Node Execution Contract boundaries are now reviewable.
- Change and Impact evidence are now present as selected-slice support artifacts.
- Evidence exceptions are explicit rather than implicit.
- Approval Brief surface is now present as a support artifact.
- Todo Search selected-slice compatibility review remains honest: no real mismatch is faked inside that slice.
- Supplemental compatibility mismatch path is now demonstrated with real ACEP task-card-only wording and a Control Node
  candidate.

Remaining blockers / gaps:

1. Product Patch `PP-001` is not user-confirmed, so stale/reopen closure cannot be fully demonstrated.
2. Refreshed title + note implementation, tests, Evidence, and renewed Acceptance do not exist.
3. Public-doc cleanup for the observed ACEP task-card-only mismatch remains deferred.
4. Fresh product command output and screenshot evidence are explicit exceptions.
5. Generated graph/read-model output is not present.
6. New artifacts are manual demo-support snapshots, not CLI-generated runtime artifacts.

Promotion blocker:

```text
Graph-source promotion readiness review should not proceed as "ready" from this result alone.
```

Next evidence strengthening should decide:

1. whether to obtain actual user confirmation for `PP-001` and produce refreshed revision Evidence, or
2. whether public-doc cleanup for the ACEP task-card-only mismatch is required before promotion readiness review, or
3. whether warning plus deferred cleanup is sufficient as an interim compatibility caveat.

## 14. Explicit Non-Promotion Statement

This demo result is not Graph-source promotion.

This demo result does not change source authority.

This demo result does not make Maintainability Graph the current operational source.

This demo result does not supersede Product, Project, Work, Test, Evidence, or Acceptance Trees.

Until a separate promotion readiness review passes and the user explicitly approves promotion, tree-native artifacts
remain the operational source of truth.

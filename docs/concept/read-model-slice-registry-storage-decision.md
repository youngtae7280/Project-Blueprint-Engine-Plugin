# Read-Model Slice Registry Storage Decision

Status: read-model-slice-registry-storage-decision / decision-surface / design-only / no-registry-file-yet /
non-enforcing

This document records the storage-location and file-format decision surface for a future read-model slice registry
fixture.

It follows:

- [read-model-validate-all-contract.md](read-model-validate-all-contract.md)
- [read-model-slice-registry-test-strategy.md](read-model-slice-registry-test-strategy.md)

It does not create the registry file, implement parser or CLI behavior, modify workflows, regenerate generated
artifacts, dispatch GitHub Actions, create PRs, introduce CI enforcement, expand source authority, perform public-doc
cleanup, or approve full Graph-source promotion.

## Decision Context

The validate-all contract defines the future all-slice validation policy. The registry test strategy defines the desired
fixture shape and tests. Before creating an actual registry file, PBE needs a decision surface for:

- where the registry should live
- which file format should be used
- what artifact role the registry has
- what may mutate it
- how existing in-code profile configuration remains compatible until parser support exists

The registry is execution metadata for future read-model validation. It is not product source, not graph source, and not
promotion approval.

## Candidate Locations

| Candidate location                                                 | Strengths                                                                                   | Risks / drawbacks                                                                                              | Current judgment                                   |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `examples/read-model-aggregate/read-model-slices.json`             | Repo-local, non-generated, near aggregate Evidence, outside any single slice, easy to parse | Creates a new config-like artifact under `examples`; requires parser support later                             | Recommended candidate for actual registry file     |
| `examples/read-model-aggregate/generated/read-model-slices.json`   | Near aggregate output files                                                                 | Generated directory implies output, may be overwritten, mixes config/source metadata with churn artifacts      | Avoid                                              |
| `examples/read-model-slices.json`                                  | Simple top-level examples registry                                                          | Less clearly tied to read-model aggregate path; may look like registry for all examples, not read-model slices | Acceptable fallback but less precise               |
| `docs/concept/read-model-slices.md/json`                           | Safe for design-only discussion                                                             | Documentation path is not ideal for future executable config; parser reading docs/concept would blur docs/code | Good for concept samples only, not execution input |
| Future `.pbe/read-model-slices.json` or `.pbe/graph/registry.json` | Closer to PBE runtime artifacts and future repo-level config                                | No repo root `.pbe` artifact exists here; could imply source authority or active runtime state too early       | Future-only after runtime artifact policy          |
| CLI internal hardcoded profile list                                | No new file; current behavior is stable                                                     | Does not scale; hides profile registry from review; makes `validate --all` less transparent                    | Short-term fallback only                           |

## Recommendation

Recommended next storage location if the actual registry file is approved:

```text
examples/read-model-aggregate/read-model-slices.json
```

Rationale:

- It is outside Todo Search and Todo App PBE Run slice ownership, so it can describe cross-slice validation without
  becoming a slice artifact.
- It is outside `generated/`, so it is not confused with command output or artifact churn.
- It is near the aggregate summary output, so readers can connect registry scope to aggregate Evidence.
- It is repo-local and easy for future CLI code to read without implying `.pbe` source authority.
- It can be introduced as a candidate fixture before parser support consumes it.

Do not place the registry under `examples/read-model-aggregate/generated/`. A registry is configuration/execution
metadata, while `generated/` is output Evidence. Mixing them would make mutation and source boundary harder to review.

## File Format Comparison

| Format    | Strengths                                                                 | Risks / drawbacks                                                                              | Current judgment                               |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| JSON      | Native parser, deterministic, Prettier support, schema-ready, no comments | Comments must live in adjacent docs; strict syntax can be less friendly                        | Recommended                                    |
| JSONC     | Allows comments while staying JSON-like                                   | Needs non-native parser choice; comment semantics must be standardized                         | Possible later if comments become important    |
| YAML      | Readable and comment-friendly                                             | More parser ambiguity; indentation sensitivity; less aligned with existing generated artifacts | Not recommended for first registry             |
| TS module | Type-safe and can share constants                                         | Blurs config with implementation; harder to treat as reviewable artifact                       | Not recommended for evidence/config fixture    |
| Markdown  | Human-friendly                                                            | Poor executable config format; parser would be fragile                                         | Documentation only, not future execution input |

Recommended first format:

```text
JSON
```

Rationale:

- future parser can use standard JSON parsing
- future schema validation is straightforward
- Prettier support is already available
- generated reports and manifests are already JSON/Markdown pairs
- comments can stay in this decision document and in adjacent README-style documentation

## Artifact Role

The future registry file should be classified as:

```text
execution metadata / validation target registry / not source authority
```

Registry inclusion means:

- the slice is included in future read-model validation scope
- the slice has a declared policy level and required artifacts
- the slice may be summarized in aggregate Evidence

Registry inclusion does not mean:

- source authority changes
- Maintainability Graph becomes source
- Todo App PBE Run becomes parity-backed, pilot-marker-backed, CI-backed, or source-authority bearing
- tree-native or canonical `.pbe` artifacts are retired
- user acceptance is replaced
- full Graph-source promotion is approved

## Mutation Boundary

Future parser behavior:

- may read registry entries
- may normalize paths for internal command planning
- may report unsupported or invalid entries
- must not silently rewrite the registry

Future `validate --all` behavior:

- may write generated reports in declared generated output directories
- may write aggregate summaries in the aggregate generated output directory
- must not mutate registry configuration unless a separate explicit config-update task is approved
- must not mutate source artifacts, manual parity artifacts, or pilot markers unless a separate artifact-update task is
  approved

Registry file changes should be ordinary reviewed source changes, not side effects of validation.

## Compatibility And Fallback

Until parser support is implemented, the existing in-code profile list remains the behavior fallback:

- `todo-search-selected-slice`
- `todo-app-pbe-run-structure-only`

The future registry file can be introduced first as a candidate fixture and compared against current in-code profiles.
Parser support can then consume it later.

Recommended compatibility sequence:

1. Create candidate registry file at the approved location.
2. Add tests that compare registry entries to current in-code profiles.
3. Implement parser/normalization against the registry fixture.
4. Implement command planner using parsed registry data.
5. Only then consider a `validate --all` command surface.

## Decision Options

| Option | Choice                                              | Meaning                                                                         | Tradeoff                                                                                      |
| ------ | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| A      | Create actual registry file next                    | Add `examples/read-model-aggregate/read-model-slices.json` as candidate fixture | Best transparency; adds a real config artifact before parser exists                           |
| B      | Implement parser against in-code fixture first      | Keep fixture data in tests/code before adding a repo artifact                   | Reduces artifact churn, but hides review surface and delays registry-as-artifact verification |
| C      | Continue hardcoded profiles until more slices exist | Avoid registry work while only two profiles exist                               | Lowest immediate cost, but delays `validate --all` readiness                                  |
| D      | Defer registry work                                 | Keep current aggregate/report-only path and PR observation only                 | Safe, but no progress toward all-slice validation implementation                              |

## Recommended Next Action

Recommended next action:

```text
Option A: create actual registry file next as a candidate fixture at examples/read-model-aggregate/read-model-slices.json
```

Conditions for that next step:

- keep the file non-generated
- use strict JSON
- mark `registryRole`, `sourceAuthorityBoundary`, and `nonPromotionStatement`
- include only the two current profiles
- do not wire the parser or CLI to consume it yet unless separately approved
- do not change workflow triggers or CI enforcement

If the next step is considered too soon, Option C is the safest fallback: continue hardcoded profiles until another
slice is ready.

## Non-Scope

This decision surface does not:

- create the registry file
- implement parser behavior
- implement command planning
- implement `validate --all`
- modify `.github/workflows/read-model-evidence.yml`
- regenerate generated artifacts
- create PRs
- dispatch GitHub Actions
- add required checks
- add branch protection
- introduce CI enforcement
- expand source authority
- approve full Graph-source promotion
- perform public-doc cleanup
- promote Todo App PBE Run beyond `structure-only`

## Final Statement

This document recommends a future registry location and JSON format, but it does not create the registry file and does
not implement any parser, CLI, workflow, enforcement, source-authority, promotion, or cleanup behavior.

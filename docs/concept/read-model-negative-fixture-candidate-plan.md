# Read-Model Negative Fixture Candidate Plan

Status: read-model-negative-fixture-candidate-plan / candidate-plan / first-three-fixtures-implemented /
later-fixtures-future

## Purpose

This document narrows the first durable negative read-model fixture candidates and records current implementation state.
It originally preceded invalid fixture files, tests, or CLI behavior. The invalid `viewScopedTags` fixture is now
implemented as local focused test input, and the missing Core View fixture is now implemented as the second durable
negative fixture. The missing pilot marker fixture is now implemented as the first durable authority-boundary negative
fixture.

It follows the storage policy in
[read-model-negative-fixture-storage-decision.md](read-model-negative-fixture-storage-decision.md), which recommends:

1. parser-shape failures stay inline/temp first
2. mutation and cross-slice leakage tests use temp workspace copies
3. durable `examples/invalid/read-model-*` fixtures are reserved for stable behavior-level validate-all failures

## Current Context

Current read-model baseline:

- candidate positive registry exists at `examples/internal-legacy/read-model-aggregate/read-model-slices.json`
- parser/normalization tests already cover duplicate IDs, missing top-level boundaries, and unknown policy levels
- local non-enforcing `pbe graph read-model validate --all` exists
- manual and PR validate-all workflow runs are reviewed as `ci-evidence-pass`
- Todo Search remains `pilot-marker-backed`
- Todo App PBE Run remains `structure-only`
- current CI runs positive configured profiles only
- the invalid `viewScopedTags`, missing Core View, and missing pilot marker fixtures are implemented as local focused
  test fixtures only
- invalid fixtures remain outside the validate-all registry and CI workflow
- CI inclusion for invalid fixtures is covered by
  [read-model-invalid-fixture-ci-policy.md](read-model-invalid-fixture-ci-policy.md), which recommends keeping them
  local-only until a separate runtime/noise/reporting decision is approved

## Candidate Comparison

### Candidate 1: Invalid `viewScopedTags`

Proposed location if implemented:

```text
examples/invalid/read-model-invalid-view-scoped-tags
```

Behavior protected:

- `viewScopedTags` must contain only allowed role tags
- view membership must remain separate from role tags
- taxonomy failures must block validation rather than becoming warnings

Why durable fixture is useful:

- tag validity is a core cross-slice invariant
- the failure is easy to understand from a small invalid generated read-model or validation report
- it protects against accidental broadening of the allowed role-tag set
- it is not tied to Todo Search authority or pilot-specific policy

High-level fixture shape:

- `README.md` or boundary marker stating this is invalid test input, not source authority
- minimal generated read-model JSON or copied report-like artifact with one invalid `viewScopedTags` value
- optional small registry/profile metadata only if future tests require path realism

Expected failing command/test behavior:

- focused test reads the invalid fixture or temp copy
- validator or helper returns blocking taxonomy failure
- no generated positive fixture is mutated
- no aggregate or CI command consumes it by default

Maintenance burden:

- low to medium
- must update if allowed role-tag policy changes
- can stay small and independent from slice-specific source artifacts

Required boundary:

- fixture is invalid test input only
- no source authority
- no promotion
- no CI enforcement

Assessment:

```text
Recommended as first durable fixture candidate.
```

### Candidate 2: Missing Core View Coverage

Proposed location if implemented:

```text
examples/invalid/read-model-core-view-missing
```

Behavior protected:

- required Core View coverage must be present when the profile requires it
- validators must not silently pass incomplete graph coverage
- aggregate pass must not hide a per-slice coverage blocker

Why durable fixture is useful:

- 7 Core View coverage is central to read-model completeness
- durable example can make the missing-coverage failure reviewable
- it complements invalid tag coverage by testing completeness rather than taxonomy

High-level fixture shape:

- `README.md` or boundary marker stating this is invalid test input
- minimal generated read-model JSON or validation report missing one required Core View entry
- expected failure note naming the missing view

Expected failing command/test behavior:

- focused test confirms missing Core View coverage produces blocking validation result
- aggregate rule test can later confirm blocking propagation if useful
- current PR workflow does not run it

Maintenance burden:

- medium
- fixture may need update if Core View coverage representation changes
- should wait until the minimal invalid shape is stable enough not to mirror too much generated output

Required boundary:

- invalid test input only
- no source authority
- no promotion
- no CI enforcement

Assessment:

```text
Recommended as second durable fixture candidate, or kept temp-only if generated coverage shape is still changing.
```

### Candidate 3: Pilot Marker Required But Missing Marker

Proposed location if implemented:

```text
examples/invalid/read-model-pilot-marker-missing
```

Behavior protected:

- `pilot-marker-backed` profiles must require a scoped pilot marker
- Todo Search-like policy cannot pass when pilot-marker Evidence disappears
- scoped source-authority boundaries remain explicit

Why durable fixture is useful:

- protects a high-value authority boundary
- directly exercises policy-level requirements beyond generic graph structure

Why not first:

- more Todo Search shaped than the tag and Core View candidates
- may need copied source/report layout that is larger than necessary
- could be mistaken as a real pilot slice unless the boundary marker is very clear

High-level fixture shape:

- `README.md` boundary marker
- minimal Todo Search-like validation inputs with `pilot-marker-backed` policy
- missing `scoped-source-authority-pilot-marker.json`
- expected blocking report/reference

Expected failing command/test behavior:

- focused test confirms pilot-marker-backed validation blocks when marker is absent
- no source/manual/generated positive artifacts are mutated

Maintenance burden:

- medium to high
- coupled to pilot-marker-backed policy and marker filename

Required boundary:

- invalid test input only
- no scoped pilot execution
- no source authority
- no promotion

Assessment:

```text
Keep as a later durable candidate after one generic durable fixture exists.
```

### Candidate 4: Structure-Only Policy Conflict

Proposed location if implemented:

```text
examples/invalid/read-model-structure-only-policy-conflict
```

Behavior protected:

- `structure-only` profiles must not accidentally require parity, pilot marker, or CI-backed Evidence
- Todo App PBE Run must not be silently promoted beyond structure-only
- policy-level requirements must match profile level

Why durable fixture is useful:

- protects Todo App PBE Run from accidental over-strengthening
- verifies policy-level separation without source-authority implications

Why not first:

- much of this can remain inline/temp by corrupting registry policy requirements
- durable fixture may need a not-yet-stable policy schema for expressing conflicts
- first durable fixtures should prove more universal validator behavior

High-level fixture shape:

- `README.md` boundary marker
- structure-only registry/profile entry that incorrectly declares parity or pilot marker required
- expected blocking policy-conflict result

Expected failing command/test behavior:

- command-plan or validate-all test rejects conflicting policy requirements
- no generated output is created or mutated

Maintenance burden:

- medium
- should wait until registry policy requirement fields are stable enough to fixture

Required boundary:

- invalid test input only
- Todo App PBE Run remains structure-only
- no promotion
- no CI enforcement

Assessment:

```text
Keep inline/temp for now; reconsider when registry policy fields are stable.
```

## Recommendation

Choose the first two generic durable candidates first:

1. `examples/invalid/read-model-invalid-view-scoped-tags`
2. `examples/invalid/read-model-core-view-missing`

Rationale:

- both protect generic read-model invariants rather than Todo Search-specific authority policy
- both are reviewable with small fixture shapes
- together they cover taxonomy and completeness
- neither requires promoting Todo App PBE Run or expanding source authority
- they can be tested locally without changing CI workflow behavior

After those generic fixtures are stable, the first authority-boundary durable fixture is:

1. `examples/invalid/read-model-pilot-marker-missing`

Current implementation status:

- `examples/invalid/read-model-invalid-view-scoped-tags` is implemented as the first durable negative fixture.
- `examples/invalid/read-model-core-view-missing` is implemented as the second durable negative fixture.
- `examples/invalid/read-model-pilot-marker-missing` is implemented as the third durable negative fixture.
- The fixtures store invalid local test input or absence metadata outside `generated/`.
- A focused test injects the invalid tag fixture into a temp Todo App PBE Run validation workspace and expects a blocking
  `view-scoped-tags-allowed` result.
- A focused test injects the missing Core View fixture into a temp Todo App PBE Run validation workspace and expects a
  blocking `core-view-coverage-present` result while `view-scoped-tags-allowed` remains passing.
- A focused test removes the scoped pilot marker from a temp Todo Search validation workspace and expects a blocking
  `pilot-marker-exists` result while parity remains `comparison-pass`.
- None of these fixtures is included in `examples/internal-legacy/read-model-aggregate/read-model-slices.json`, `validate --all`, or CI.

Inline/temp coverage now established:

- `structure-only policy conflict`

Rationale:

- structure-only policy conflict is better expressed as an inline/temp registry mutation until policy fields stabilize
- the registry normalization test now rejects structure-only entries that require `compare`, parity, or pilot marker
  artifacts
- no durable `examples/invalid/read-model-structure-only-policy-conflict` fixture is needed yet

## Suggested Implementation Sequence

For any future durable fixture implementation:

1. Add fixture README/boundary marker for each selected durable fixture.
2. Add minimal invalid artifact(s) only; avoid copying a full generated slice unless necessary.
3. Add focused tests asserting the expected blocking behavior.
4. Keep fixtures outside `generated/`.
5. Do not mutate positive fixtures.
6. Do not wire invalid fixtures into CI workflow.
7. Keep invalid fixtures out of `validate --all` positive registry unless a separate invalid-fixture runner is designed.

## Non-Scope

This candidate plan and the first three implemented fixtures do not:

- create additional `examples/invalid/read-model-*` fixtures beyond the approved invalid tag and missing Core View
  fixtures plus the missing pilot marker fixture
- create a durable structure-only policy conflict fixture
- modify CLI command behavior
- modify `.github/workflows/read-model-evidence.yml`
- regenerate generated artifacts
- create a PR
- dispatch GitHub Actions
- add required checks
- add branch protection
- introduce CI enforcement
- expand source authority
- perform public-doc cleanup
- promote Todo App PBE Run beyond `structure-only`
- approve full Graph-source promotion

## Final Statement

This document narrows the first durable negative fixture candidates, records that the invalid `viewScopedTags`, missing
Core View, and missing pilot marker fixtures are implemented as local focused test fixtures, and records structure-only
policy conflict as inline/temp registry coverage. It does not implement workflow changes, enforcement, source authority
expansion, or promotion.

# Graph-Source Required-Check Readiness

Status: policy package / repo-side Candidate B check surface present / branch protection not configured

## Purpose

This package defines when Graph-source health, E2E smoke, validate-all, and edgeIntent reporting could become required
checks. Candidate B now has a named repository-side script and CI job, but this package does not configure GitHub branch
protection, source-authority expansion, user acceptance, or tree-native retirement.

## Current State

Current observations are strong enough for a readiness discussion:

- local/manual observations: pass
- PR informational observations: pass
- tiny behavior-change dogfood: pass
- `graph read-model report-health --json`: `graph-source-health-pass`
- `npm run test:read-model:e2e`: `e2e-smoke-pass`
- Candidate B repo-side command: `npm run check:graph-source:candidate-b`
- Candidate B CI surface: `PBE CI / Candidate B Read-Model Check`
- `graph read-model report-intent --json`: `intent-report-pass`
- `graph read-model validate --all --json`: `aggregate-pass`
- branch protection status: `not-configured`
- tree-native retirement: not executed

The machine-readable status lives in
`examples/read-model-aggregate/graph-source-transition-status.json.enforcementReadiness`.

## Candidate Options

| Candidate                         | Scope                                                   | Current status                 | Effect today                                                       |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| A. Informational only             | Manual/local/PR informational observation               | Active                         | No required check, no branch protection, no merge gate             |
| B. Health + E2E check surface     | `report-health` plus `test:read-model:e2e`              | Repo-side check surface exists | Named script and CI job exist; branch protection still manual      |
| C. Full read-model gate candidate | `validate --all`, `report-health`, E2E, `report-intent` | Future candidate, not enabled  | No required check yet; broader blocking semantics need more review |

## Recommended Path

Recommended sequence:

1. Stay non-enforcing while recording readiness.
2. Keep Candidate B as the first named repo-side check surface.
3. Require explicit user approval before branch protection requires Candidate B.
4. Define waiver/failure policy before Candidate B can block merge through branch protection.
5. Keep enforcement readiness separate from tree-native retirement.

Candidate C should wait until Candidate B is reviewed or the user explicitly accepts broader read-model blocking
semantics.

## Candidate B Soft-Required Package

Candidate B is recorded in
[graph-source-soft-required-candidate-b-package.md](graph-source-soft-required-candidate-b-package.md).

Candidate B is the narrow command pair:

```text
node dist/cli/index.js graph read-model report-health --json
npm.cmd run test:read-model:e2e
```

The named repository command is:

```text
npm.cmd run check:graph-source:candidate-b
```

The CI surface is:

```text
PBE CI / Candidate B Read-Model Check
```

The package separates false positive handling, infrastructure failure handling, retained warning handling, and temporary
GitHub Actions failure handling. It is still not configured as a branch protection rule, GitHub required-check setting,
source-authority promotion, Product acceptance, user acceptance, or tree-native retirement approval.

## Required Approval Before Implementation

The following actions require explicit user approval and a separate settings or implementation step:

- configuring branch protection to require Candidate B;
- turning Candidate B into a merge gate;
- enabling branch protection;
- treating health, E2E, validate-all, or intent report as user acceptance;
- retiring tree-native artifacts.

## Readiness Gaps

Current blockers:

- no explicit user approval for branch protection;
- waiver/failure policy exists as Candidate B documentation but is not a branch-protection policy;
- GitHub branch protection is not configured from this repository change;
- tree-native retirement remains not approved and must not be bundled into enforcement readiness;
- Candidate B has not yet been reviewed as a branch-protection-required PR check.

## Boundary

This package is a decision surface plus a named repo-side check surface. It changes package script/CI naming,
documentation, and readiness metadata only; it does not configure branch protection or change source authority.

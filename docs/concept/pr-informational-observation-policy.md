# PR Informational Observation Policy

Status: pr-informational-observation-policy / observation-policy-established / non-enforcing

## Purpose

This document defines how PBE should observe the non-enforcing PR informational read-model Evidence workflow before
changing path filters, failure semantics, CI enforcement, validation scope, or promotion readiness policy.

The current workflow already supports:

```text
workflow_dispatch
pull_request informational with path filters
```

This policy turns `Keep PR informational workflow non-enforcing and observe more PRs` into a reviewable observation
surface. It does not modify `.github/workflows/read-model-evidence.yml`, create new pull requests, dispatch GitHub
Actions, add required checks, change source authority, approve full Graph-source promotion, or replace user acceptance.

The operational append-only log and runbook for applying this policy is
[pr-informational-observation-log.md](pr-informational-observation-log.md). Future PR run reviews should record entries
there before path-filter, failure-semantics, enforcement, or validation-scope changes are considered.

All-slice validation is tracked separately in
[read-model-validate-all-contract.md](read-model-validate-all-contract.md). This PR observation policy does not approve
enforcement or source-authority consequences from `validate --all` workflow results.
Non-enforcing CI workflow integration of local `validate --all` is recorded in
[ci-validate-all-integration-design.md](ci-validate-all-integration-design.md). The first PR informational run after
that switch is now reviewed as PR #2 / run `28210904900`.
The third PR informational observation is now reviewed as PR #3 / run `28213236499`; the recommended run-count
observation threshold is satisfied, but path-filter or failure-semantics changes still require a separate decision.
That separate decision surface is recorded in
[pr-informational-path-filter-refinement.md](pr-informational-path-filter-refinement.md). It recommends keeping the
current filters and failure semantics unchanged for now because no blocker, false positive, repeated noise, or hidden
boundary issue has been observed.
Registry fixture and test planning for that future path is tracked in
[read-model-slice-registry-test-strategy.md](read-model-slice-registry-test-strategy.md).
Negative fixture storage policy is tracked in
[read-model-negative-fixture-storage-decision.md](read-model-negative-fixture-storage-decision.md); invalid fixtures are
not part of current PR informational workflow runs.
The CI inclusion decision surface for invalid fixtures is tracked in
[read-model-invalid-fixture-ci-policy.md](read-model-invalid-fixture-ci-policy.md). It recommends keeping invalid
fixtures local-only for now, so PR informational observation continues to cover positive configured profiles only.

| Observation threshold         | 3 real PR informational runs reviewed; refinement can be considered but is not automatic                             |
| Authority boundary            | CI/PR Evidence is Evidence only; no source authority expansion, full promotion, enforcement, or user acceptance swap |

## Observation Purpose

PR informational observation exists to make graph read-model Evidence drift visible during ordinary PR work.

It should answer:

- Does the workflow run when expected PR paths change?
- Does the run produce artifact bundles and Step Summary output reliably?
- Are Todo Search, Todo App DevView Run, and aggregate statuses stable?
- Are retained warnings and source-authority boundaries still visible?
- Are path filters too broad, too narrow, or correctly balanced?
- Does any failure represent runtime/tooling breakage, artifact integrity failure, evidence warning, decision-required
  status, or a true blocker?

It should not:

- enforce merges
- become a required check
- change source authority
- expand the Todo Search scoped pilot
- promote Todo App DevView Run beyond `structure-only`
- approve full Graph-source promotion
- replace user acceptance

## Observation Metrics

Each observed PR informational run should record, at minimum:

| Metric group                | Fields to record                                                                                                                                        |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Run identity                | run id, run URL, event, trigger mode, workflow name, run attempt, conclusion, job id, duration                                                          |
| PR identity                 | PR number, PR status, head SHA, base SHA, head ref, base ref                                                                                            |
| Changed path categories     | workflow, CLI, scripts, Todo Search slice, Todo App DevView Run slice, aggregate artifacts, concept docs, other                                         |
| Artifact availability       | artifact bundle present, manifest present, validation reports present, parity report present where required, aggregate summary present                  |
| Todo Search status          | validation status, parity status, check count, node/edge count, warning/blocking/decision-required counts                                               |
| Todo App DevView Run status | validation status, policy level, parity requirement/status, check count, node/edge count, warning/blocking/decision-required counts                     |
| Aggregate status            | aggregate status, slice count, warning/blocking/decision-required counts, retained warning count                                                        |
| Boundary visibility         | source authority boundary present, non-enforcement statement present, non-promotion statement present, retained warnings remain visible                 |
| Failure classification      | command/runtime failure, artifact integrity failure, evidence warning, decision-required, true blocker, false positive/noise                            |
| Observation interpretation  | whether the run supports continued observation, path-filter refinement, runtime/cost optimization, failure-semantics revision, or escalation discussion |

## Recommended Observation Window

Recommended minimum observation before path-filter or failure-semantics changes:

```text
Observe at least 3 real PR informational runs, or at least 1 week of normal PR activity, whichever gives better signal.
```

Immediate re-review is required before the observation window completes if any of the following occurs:

- source-authority boundary wording disappears or becomes ambiguous
- retained warnings disappear from generated artifacts or summaries
- `triggerMode` no longer distinguishes `pull_request-informational`
- PR metadata is missing from a PR-triggered manifest
- Todo Search parity changes away from `comparison-pass`
- Todo Search or Todo App validation becomes `validation-blocked` or `decision-required`
- aggregate status becomes `aggregate-blocked` or `decision-required`
- artifact upload is missing or malformed
- workflow failures appear unrelated to changed paths and repeat across PRs
- PR UI red status starts being treated socially as a merge blocker despite the non-enforcing policy

## Path-Filter Refinement Criteria

The current path set intentionally favors visibility over minimizing every run:

```text
.github/workflows/read-model-evidence.yml
cli/src/**
scripts/**
examples/internal-legacy/adoption/todo-search-slice/**
examples/valid/todo-app-devview-run/**
examples/internal-legacy/read-model-aggregate/**
docs/concept/**
```

### Narrowing Criteria

Consider narrowing filters if observation shows:

- `docs/concept/**` causes repeated informational runs for unrelated concept-only edits with no Evidence drift value
- generated artifact timestamp/source-commit churn dominates PR changes without meaningful review signal
- `scripts/**` runs too often for scripts unrelated to PBE/read-model validation
- aggregate-only artifact changes create repeated runs when per-slice reports are unchanged
- runtime/cost becomes disproportionate for low-risk documentation PRs

Possible narrowing options:

- split `docs/concept/**` into read-model/source-transition focused concept paths
- split `scripts/**` into validation/build scripts that affect read-model Evidence
- include aggregate contract docs but exclude generated aggregate artifacts unless per-slice report changes are present
- keep docs broad but make the Step Summary explicitly classify doc-only PRs as lower risk

### Broadening Criteria

Consider broadening filters if observation shows:

- read-model Evidence inputs can drift from paths outside the current set
- package/build configuration changes affect CLI generation or validation reliability
- schema/template changes affect generated or validated report structure
- future slice profiles are added outside the current example paths
- action/runtime configuration changes move outside `.github/workflows/read-model-evidence.yml`

Possible broadening options:

- include `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `tsconfig*.json`, or validator schema/template paths
- include future profile directories after they become generated/validated Evidence inputs
- include docs that define source authority or Evidence policy outside `docs/concept/**` if they become active

### Tradeoff Rule

Prefer broad filters while the workflow is informational and the observation sample is small. Prefer narrower filters
only after real PR evidence shows repeated low-value noise.

## Failure Classification Policy

| Failure / status type               | Interpretation                                                                               | Default action                                                                                 |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Command/runtime failure             | Workflow health or toolchain problem.                                                        | Investigate and fix or record blocker.                                                         |
| Artifact integrity failure          | Required output missing, malformed, or inconsistent.                                         | Treat as blocker for Evidence trust until resolved.                                            |
| Evidence warning                    | Run completed but warns about retained limitation or non-blocking drift.                     | Keep visible; do not treat as merge enforcement unless later policy says so.                   |
| `decision-required`                 | User judgment may be needed for source/acceptance/risk/authority implications.               | Surface clearly; do not auto-resolve.                                                          |
| True blocker                        | Boundary, parity, validation, or aggregate state blocks safe Evidence interpretation.        | Stop broader progression and create a focused fix/review task.                                 |
| False positive / noise              | Run is technically correct but low-value for the changed PR path.                            | Count toward path-filter refinement evidence.                                                  |
| Social enforcement risk             | Non-required PR red/green status is being treated as a merge gate without explicit approval. | Revisit Step Summary wording or failure semantics before considering required-check policy.    |
| Hidden warning / boundary ambiguity | Warning or authority boundary is missing from artifacts, manifest, or summary.               | Immediate re-review; do not proceed toward enforcement or promotion until visibility is fixed. |

## Escalation Criteria

### Path-Filter Refinement

Open a path-filter refinement task when:

- two or more observed PR runs are low-value noise from the same path category
- doc-only PRs dominate the observation set without exposing useful Evidence drift
- an expected Evidence-impacting path does not trigger the workflow
- artifact churn repeatedly appears without corresponding source or policy changes

### Runtime / Cost Optimization

Open an optimization task when:

- workflow duration grows enough to slow normal PR review
- dependency install/build dominates runtime and can be safely cached or split
- the same command sequence is repeated in ways that can be simplified without hiding Evidence

### Failure-Semantics Revision

Open a failure-semantics revision task when:

- non-blocking Evidence warnings repeatedly create confusing PR red status
- decision-required status needs a stronger Step Summary without merge enforcement
- command failures and Evidence judgment statuses are not distinguishable enough to reviewers

### Required Check / Enforcement Discussion

Reopen required check or enforcement design only after:

- PR informational mode has multiple reviewed successful runs
- path filters are stable enough to avoid excessive noise
- failure semantics separate command failures from Evidence judgment
- retained warnings remain visible
- user explicitly chooses to discuss enforcement

Required checks remain a separate decision and cannot be inferred from `ci-evidence-pass`.

### Broader Validation / `validate --all` Discussion

Reopen broader validation scope or `validate --all` workflow integration only after:

- per-slice reports stay independent
- aggregate summary remains stable
- additional slice profiles have clear policy levels
- Todo App DevView Run remains correctly classified unless separately strengthened
- source authority boundaries remain unambiguous

The non-enforcing CI workflow switch to local `validate --all` is implemented and reviewed in
[ci-validate-all-integration-design.md](ci-validate-all-integration-design.md). PR #2 / run `28210904900` and PR #3 /
run `28213236499` are reviewed post-switch PR informational observations. The three-real-PR count threshold is
satisfied, so path-filter or failure-semantics refinement can be considered as a separate decision surface; enforcement
still requires a separate user decision.

## Observation Record Template

Future PR observation notes should include:

```text
PR:
Run:
Event / triggerMode:
Head / base:
Changed path categories:
Artifact bundle:
Manifest status:
Todo Search status:
Todo App DevView Run status:
Aggregate status:
Warnings / blockers / decision-required:
Boundary visibility:
Noise / false positive assessment:
Recommended follow-up:
```

The detailed reusable entry template, review checklist, changed-path categories, and observation counter live in
[pr-informational-observation-log.md](pr-informational-observation-log.md).

## Non-Scope

This policy does not:

- modify `.github/workflows/read-model-evidence.yml`
- change workflow triggers
- create a new PR
- dispatch GitHub Actions
- add required checks
- add branch protection
- introduce CI enforcement
- implement `validate --all`
- expand source authority
- approve full Graph-source promotion
- perform public-doc cleanup
- retire tree-native or `.devview` artifacts
- promote Todo App DevView Run beyond `structure-only`
- make PR informational pass equivalent to user acceptance

## Gate Self-Check

| Gate                             | Result | Notes                                                                                  |
| -------------------------------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Observation-Only Gate            | PASS   | Defines observation policy only; no workflow/code/PR/run changes.                      |
| Non-Enforcement Gate             | PASS   | Required checks, branch protection, and CI enforcement remain out of scope.            |
| Source Authority Boundary Gate   | PASS   | PR Evidence remains Evidence only and does not expand source authority.                |
| Non-Full-Promotion Gate          | PASS   | Full Graph-source promotion remains separate and unapproved.                           |
| Path-Filter Refinement Gate      | PASS   | Defines criteria for later refinement without changing filters now.                    |
| Failure Semantics Clarity Gate   | PASS   | Separates command/runtime failure, artifact integrity, warning, decision, and blocker. |
| Retained Warning Visibility Gate | PASS   | Hidden warning or boundary ambiguity triggers immediate re-review.                     |
| Todo App Structure-Only Gate     | PASS   | Todo App DevView Run remains structure-only.                                           |
| User Approval Boundary Gate      | PASS   | PR pass cannot replace user acceptance or approve enforcement/promotion.               |
| Public-Doc Cleanup Boundary Gate | PASS   | Cleanup remains deferred and is not performed by this policy.                          |

## Final Statement

PR informational observation is a non-enforcing Evidence observation policy. It keeps the workflow visible and
reviewable while preserving source authority, promotion, public-doc cleanup, validation-scope, and user-acceptance
boundaries.

| ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| OQ-001 | Should the Maintainability Graph remain a conceptual traceability view, or become a generated artifact after the concept baseline is accepted? | This changes file formats, validators, and migration work.                  | Phase 3+     |
| OQ-002 | Should View Tree Pack be documented only as a conceptual projection, or should it later map to concrete `.pbe` files?                          | This affects artifact layout and compatibility guarantees.                  | Phase 3+     |
| OQ-003 | What exact approval summary belongs in an Approval Brief without weakening the Acceptance Tree rule?                                           | Approval policy is intentionally outline-only in this pass.                 | Phase 3+     |
| OQ-004 | Which legacy documents still use superseded terms as active architecture rather than historical or compatibility language?                     | Public docs may need later cleanup once the canonical baseline is approved. | Phase 3+     |
| OQ-005 | What evidence quality thresholds should apply to concept-level checks versus execution evidence?                                               | Check/Evidence policy is intentionally outline-only in this pass.           | Phase 3+     |

## Not Active Here

Detailed TypeScript models, CLI command design, validator implementation, migration scripts, and feasibility
demonstration are not open questions for this phase. They are next-phase work candidates.

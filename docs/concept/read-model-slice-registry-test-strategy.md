# Read-Model Slice Registry Test Strategy

Status: read-model-slice-registry-test-strategy / design-only / no-implementation / non-enforcing

This document defines the registry fixture and test strategy needed before implementing a future all-slice read-model
validation surface such as `pbe graph read-model validate --all`.

It extends [read-model-validate-all-contract.md](read-model-validate-all-contract.md) by specifying what the future
registry fixture should look like, what positive and negative fixtures should prove, and which focused tests should
protect source-authority, aggregate, and non-mutation boundaries.

This document does not create an actual registry file, implement parser or CLI code, change workflows, regenerate
generated artifacts, dispatch GitHub Actions, create PRs, introduce enforcement, expand source authority, perform
public-doc cleanup, or approve full Graph-source promotion.

The storage and file-format decision surface for the future registry fixture is recorded in
[read-model-slice-registry-storage-decision.md](read-model-slice-registry-storage-decision.md). This strategy should not
be treated as approval to create that file.

## Relationship To Validate-All Contract

The validate-all contract defines the policy surface:

- known profiles
- registry concept
- execution modes
- aggregate relation
- failure semantics
- source-authority boundary
- PR observation separation

This strategy defines how a future implementation should be tested before those concepts become executable behavior.

The intended sequence is:

1. design registry fixture shape
2. design positive and negative fixture expectations
3. implement a registry fixture only after explicit approval
4. implement parser/normalization tests
5. implement command-plan tests
6. implement all-slice validation behavior only after registry behavior is stable

## Proposed Registry Fixture Shape

Prefer a small explicit registry fixture over directory discovery. A future file could be JSON, JSONC, or another
repo-native structured format, but this task intentionally does not create the file.

Conceptual shape:

```json

  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "registryRole": "read-model-slice-registry-fixture",
  "sourceAuthorityBoundary": "registry config is execution metadata only; it does not change source authority",

  "profiles": [

      ],
      "optionalArtifacts": ["generated/read-model-ci-evidence-manifest.json"],
      "expectedCounts": {
        "nodes": 40,
        "edges": 59,
        "validationChecks": 20
      },
      "requiredBoundaryStatements": ["sourceAuthorityBoundary", "nonPromotionStatement"],
      "retainedWarnings": ["bounded-fixture", "partial-ui-evidence", "public-doc-cleanup-deferred"],
      "fallbackReferences": ["tree-native selected-slice artifacts", "manual read-model parity artifact"],
      "ciInclusion": "manual-and-pr-informational"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Future Negative Fixture Categories

Negative fixtures should be lightweight and isolated. Prefer temp fixtures or `examples/invalid` only after the storage
policy is approved. Do not mutate current positive slice artifacts to produce negative cases.

| Category                                      | Expected result                                                                  |
| --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Unsupported profile ID                        | Blocking: registry references an unknown profile and no command plan is guessed. |
| Missing source input                          | Blocking unless the profile declares an accepted limitation.                     |
| Missing required artifact                     | Blocking for report-only mode or after future execution mode completes.          |
| Wrong policy-level requirements               | Blocking: e.g. structure-only unexpectedly requires parity or pilot marker.      |
| Hidden retained warning                       | Blocking: known warning disappears without Evidence.                             |
| Source authority boundary missing             | Blocking or decision-required depending on severity.                             |
| Invalid `viewScopedTags`                      | Blocking taxonomy failure.                                                       |
| Missing Core View coverage                    | Blocking for profiles that require 7 Core View coverage.                         |
| Parity required but missing comparison report | Blocking for parity-backed or pilot-marker-backed profiles.                      |
| Pilot marker required but missing marker      | Blocking for pilot-marker-backed profiles.                                       |
| Structure-only profile requiring parity/pilot | Blocking policy confusion; structure-only must remain lightweight.               |
| Aggregate input malformed                     | Aggregate blocked; do not regenerate silently.                                   |
| Cross-slice dependency leakage                | Blocking: one slice validation depends on another slice's generated directory.   |

## Test Classes

### Registry Parsing / Normalization Tests

Validate that a future registry parser:

- accepts the two current positive profiles
- rejects duplicate `profileId`
- rejects missing `sourceSlice`, `sourceLayout`, or `policyLevel`
- normalizes slash direction without changing semantic paths
- rejects unknown `policyLevel`
- preserves boundary statements and retained-warning declarations

### Command Plan Construction Tests

Validate that future planning:

- builds `generate + compare + validate` for Todo Search
- builds `generate + validate` for Todo App PBE Run
- does not plan compare for `structure-only`
- does not plan pilot-marker checks for `structure-only`
- does not run unregistered slices by discovery
- reports unsupported profiles instead of guessing commands

### Per-Policy Requirement Tests

Validate that policy levels drive required artifacts:

- `structure-only` requires generated read-model and validation report
- `parity-backed` requires comparison report
- `pilot-marker-backed` requires comparison report and pilot marker
- runtime fixture requirements are profile-specific
- retained warnings are required visibility fields, not validation failures when explicitly accepted

### Per-Slice Independence Tests

Validate that each profile uses only its declared source slice and artifacts:

- Todo Search validation does not depend on Todo App generated files
- Todo App validation does not depend on Todo Search manual parity or pilot marker
- report-only aggregate reads only declared per-slice validation reports
- temp workspace tests remove unrelated slices to prove independence

### Aggregate Status Rule Tests

Validate aggregate propagation:

- all pass -> `aggregate-pass`
- warning without blocking/decision-required -> `aggregate-warning`
- any blocking -> `aggregate-blocked`
- any decision-required -> `decision-required`
- missing/malformed required report -> aggregate blocked
- aggregate does not mutate per-slice reports or regenerate artifacts

### Non-Mutation Tests

Validate that future all-slice runs:

- do not edit source artifacts unexpectedly
- do not edit manual parity artifacts
- do not rewrite pilot markers
- write only declared generated/report outputs for the selected execution mode
- leave report-only mode input files unchanged

### Boundary Statement Tests

Validate that every output includes:

- source authority boundary
- non-promotion statement
- user acceptance boundary
- retained warning visibility
- fallback/reference summary
- policy-level statement

### Fixture Drift Tests

Validate that positive fixture expectations stay intentional:

- Todo Search remains 40 nodes / 59 edges / 20 validation checks unless a deliberate update records why
- Todo Search parity remains `comparison-pass`
- Todo App PBE Run remains 22 nodes / 38 edges / 16 validation checks unless a deliberate update records why
- Todo App PBE Run remains `structure-only`
- aggregate over current reports remains `aggregate-pass` when per-slice reports are valid

## Test Execution Ordering

Future all-slice implementation tests should proceed in this order:

1. parse registry
2. normalize registry paths and profile metadata
3. verify source input existence
4. construct command plan
5. run/generate/compare/validate in future execution mode
6. summarize existing reports
7. assert aggregate status
8. assert no unintended input mutation
9. assert boundary statements and retained warnings remain visible

Report-only mode should skip command execution steps and start from existing validation reports.

## Implementation Readiness Criteria

This strategy is enough to request implementation of a registry fixture when:

- the registry fixture storage location is approved through
  [read-model-slice-registry-storage-decision.md](read-model-slice-registry-storage-decision.md)
- the file format is selected through the storage decision surface
- positive fixture expectations above are accepted
- negative fixture storage policy is selected
- parser/normalization behavior is agreed
- all-slice execution mode default is chosen
- report output location is chosen
- mutation boundary is clear

Before `validate --all` CLI implementation begins:

- a registry fixture or equivalent profile source must exist
- parser and planner tests should be implemented first
- positive and negative fixture behavior should be testable without changing current source artifacts
- aggregate summary behavior should remain compatible with existing report-only command
- PR informational workflow should not be changed unless separately approved

## Non-Scope

This strategy does not:

- create an actual registry file
- implement a registry parser
- implement command planning
- implement `validate --all`
- modify `.github/workflows/read-model-evidence.yml`
- regenerate generated artifacts
- create PRs
- dispatch GitHub Actions
- add required checks
- add branch protection
- introduce CI enforcement
- expand source authority
- approve full Graph-source promotion
- perform public-doc cleanup
- promote Todo App PBE Run beyond `structure-only`

## Gate Self-Check

| Gate                           | Result | Notes                                                                                 |
| ------------------------------ | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Design-Only Gate               | PASS   | Defines test strategy only; no code, registry file, workflow, PR, or Actions changes. |
| Registry Fixture Shape Gate    | PASS   | Proposed fields are explicit and profile-driven.                                      |
| Positive Fixture Clarity Gate  | PASS   | Todo Search and Todo App PBE Run expected policy levels and counts are declared.      |
| Negative Fixture Honesty Gate  | PASS   | Failure categories are visible and should not mutate positive source artifacts.       |
| Test Class Coverage Gate       | PASS   | Parser, planning, policy, independence, aggregate, non-mutation, boundary, and drift. |
| Non-Mutation Gate              | PASS   | Future tests must prove source/manual/pilot/report-only inputs remain unchanged.      |
| Aggregate Boundary Gate        | PASS   | Aggregate tests remain Evidence-only and do not imply source authority.               |
| Non-CI-Enforcement Gate        | PASS   | CI enforcement and workflow changes remain separate.                                  |
| Source Authority Boundary Gate | PASS   | Registry inclusion is not source authority or promotion.                              |
| User Approval Boundary Gate    | PASS   | Implementation and enforcement remain separate user decisions.                        |

## Final Statement

This strategy makes the future registry and test surface reviewable before implementation. It does not implement a
registry, parser, command planner, `validate --all`, CI workflow change, enforcement, source authority expansion, or
Graph-source promotion.

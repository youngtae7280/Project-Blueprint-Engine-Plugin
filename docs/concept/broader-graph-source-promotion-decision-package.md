# Broader Graph-Source Promotion Decision Package

Status: decision-package-used / limited-promotion-executed / repo-wide-promotion-not-executed

## Purpose

This package collected the matured Graph/read-model Evidence stack, public-doc cleanup status, candidate authority
matrix, and rollback/fallback plan into one user decision surface.

The user subsequently selected the limited promotion branch. The execution record is
[broader-graph-source-promotion-execution-record.md](broader-graph-source-promotion-execution-record.md).

This package still does not execute repo-wide Graph-source promotion. It does not retire tree-native artifacts, change
workflow behavior, add enforcement, regenerate Evidence, or replace user acceptance.

Readiness label:

```text
promotion-decision-package-ready / preparation-complete-with-user-decision-required
```

Original meaning:

```text
pre-promotion preparation package is complete; actual promotion remains blocked on explicit user approval
```

Current decision outcome:

```text
approve limited Graph-source promotion execution
```

## Current State

| Field                      | Value                                                                                                                     |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Preparation state          | `preparation-complete`                                                                                                    |
| Decision surface state     | `decision-used`                                                                                                           |
| Promotion execution        | `limited-promotion-executed`                                                                                              |
| Current operational source | Maintainability Graph for promoted Todo Search selected-slice scope; tree-native artifacts elsewhere.                     |
| Candidate source model     | Maintainability Graph is promoted only for the bounded execution-record scope and remains candidate/read-model elsewhere. |
| User approval boundary     | Codex, CI, validators, generated reports, and aggregate summaries still cannot self-approve further authority changes.    |

## Decision Options

The user can choose one of these next branches. Any execution requires a later scoped implementation step after the
choice is explicit.

| Option                                                       | Meaning                                                                                                                                   | Immediate effect if selected                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Approve limited Graph-source promotion                       | Approve a bounded source authority change under the reviewed candidate authority matrix and rollback/fallback plan.                       | Selected and executed in [broader-graph-source-promotion-execution-record.md](broader-graph-source-promotion-execution-record.md). |
| Continue observation                                         | Keep the scoped pilot, registry-backed validate-all, manual CI, PR informational CI, and local negative fixtures as observation surfaces. | No source authority change; keep current workflow and registry boundaries.                                                         |
| Request revisions to authority matrix / rollback plan / docs | Ask for specific revisions before any approval branch is eligible.                                                                        | Update the relevant concept package and rerun docs validation.                                                                     |
| Defer or rollback scoped pilot                               | Stop broader promotion preparation or move the Todo Search scoped pilot back toward fallback/reference-only status.                       | Prepare a separate defer/rollback decision record before any state-changing action.                                                |
| Design enforcement/required-check policy separately          | Keep source authority decisions separate while exploring whether read-model Evidence should ever become a required check.                 | Create a separate enforcement design surface only; no branch protection or required check is added here.                           |

## Recommended Default

Historical recommended default before the user selected a branch:

```text
decision-ready; wait for explicit user choice
```

Current status:

```text
limited branch executed; further repo-wide promotion still requires a separate user choice
```

## User Approval Language

Use this boundary for any follow-up:

```text
Codex, CI, validators, generated reports, aggregate summaries, and successful PR runs cannot self-approve Graph-source
promotion or source authority expansion. The user must explicitly approve any authority change, artifact retirement,
enforcement change, waiver, defer decision, or rollback decision.
```

## Explicit Non-Scope

This decision package and its limited execution do not:

- execute repo-wide Graph-source promotion
- expand source authority beyond the Todo Search selected-slice execution scope
- retire tree-native artifacts
- change workflow behavior, code, CLI behavior, tests, generated artifacts, registry entries, or examples
- regenerate or commit generated artifacts
- add required checks, branch protection, CI enforcement, push triggers, or schedule triggers
- add invalid fixtures to CI or the positive validate-all registry
- promote Todo App PBE Run beyond `structure-only`
- approve a public-doc cleanup waiver
- replace user acceptance with CI, validation, generated Evidence, or Codex judgment

## Post-Preparation Work

After this package, remaining work is not preparation by default. The first decision-dependent execution branch has now
run:

| If the user chooses...                   | Next work should be...                                                                                                |
| ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Approve limited promotion                | Executed by [broader-graph-source-promotion-execution-record.md](broader-graph-source-promotion-execution-record.md). |
| Continue observation                     | Keep recording manual/PR runs and retained warnings without changing workflow, authority, or registry.                |
| Request revisions                        | Revise the named package, rerun docs validation, and return to this decision surface.                                 |
| Defer or rollback scoped pilot           | Prepare defer/rollback records and preserve tree-native fallback/reference authority.                                 |
| Design enforcement/required-check policy | Create a separate non-executing enforcement policy design; do not couple it to promotion approval.                    |

## Final Preparation Statement

The pre-promotion preparation package was completed for user judgment and the user selected the limited promotion
branch.

The limited branch is now executed for Todo Search selected-slice authority only.

It is not a repo-wide `promotion executed` claim, not tree-native artifact retirement, not enforcement approval, and not
a replacement for user acceptance.

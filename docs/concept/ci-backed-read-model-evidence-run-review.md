# CI-Backed Read-Model Evidence Run Review

Status: ci-backed-read-model-evidence-run-review / node24-ci-hygiene-pass-reviewed / non-enforcing-manual-run

## Review Purpose

This document records reviewed GitHub Actions runs for read-model Evidence, with the latest review covering the
aggregate-enabled workflow:

```text
PBE Read-Model Evidence
```

The purpose is to verify that a real CI-backed Evidence run exists, that its uploaded artifact bundle is reviewable, that
the aggregate-enabled manifest is internally consistent, and that source-authority and non-promotion boundaries are
preserved.

This review supersedes the earlier blocked attempt that could not dispatch the workflow because local GitHub CLI was not
authenticated. User-authenticated manual workflow runs are now available and reviewed.

The aggregate-enabled manual workflow run is reviewed in this document. A later Node 24 CI hygiene run confirms that the
workflow action/runtime update still produces the same aggregate Evidence result without the prior Node.js 20
deprecation annotation. The older Todo Search-only run remains as historical CI-backed Evidence for the first workflow
shape.

## Boundary

This review is non-enforcing CI Evidence review only.

It does not:

- add branch protection
- create or require a PR check
- add PR or push triggers
- introduce CI enforcement
- change source authority
- expand the source-authority pilot scope beyond `examples/adoption/todo-search-slice`
- make `examples/valid/todo-app-pbe-run` parity-backed, pilot-marker-backed, or authority-bearing
- approve full Graph-source promotion
- perform public-doc cleanup
- retire tree-native artifacts
- hide retained warnings
- treat CI pass as user approval

The run was manually dispatched on `main`. It did not run as a PR check, push trigger, scheduled job, required check, or
branch-protection gate.

## Aggregate-Enabled Step Review Result

All relevant workflow steps completed successfully:

- Build CLI
- Generate Todo Search read-model Evidence
- Compare Todo Search generated and manual read-model Evidence
- Validate Todo Search read-model Evidence
- Generate Todo App PBE Run structure-only read-model Evidence
- Validate Todo App PBE Run structure-only read-model Evidence
- Summarize aggregate read-model Evidence
- Focused read-model Evidence tests
- Todo Search runtime fixture tests
- Validate PBE plugin files
- Validate PBE tree schemas
- Write CI evidence manifest
- Write evidence summary
- Upload read-model Evidence artifacts

GitHub emitted one maintenance annotation:

```text
Node.js 20 is deprecated. The following actions target Node.js 20 but are being forced to run on Node.js 24: actions/checkout@v4, actions/setup-node@v4, actions/upload-artifact@v4.
```

This annotation was a visible CI workflow maintenance warning, not a failed Evidence run. It did not block the reviewed
aggregate Evidence result. It was later addressed by updating the manual workflow to Node 24 action/runtime settings and
reviewing post-update run `28157938343`.

## Post-Update Node 24 CI Hygiene Run

After the workflow was updated to use `actions/checkout@v7`, `actions/setup-node@v6` with `node-version: 24`, and
`actions/upload-artifact@v7`, the manual workflow was dispatched again.

The run was manually dispatched on `main`. It did not run as a PR check, push trigger, scheduled job, required check, or
branch-protection gate.

All relevant workflow steps completed successfully, including Todo Search generation/comparison/validation, Todo App
PBE Run structure-only generation/validation, aggregate summarize, focused tests, runtime fixture tests, PBE validation,
CI manifest creation, step summary creation, and artifact upload.

Log review did not observe the prior Node.js 20 deprecation annotation after the Node 24 action/runtime update. An
unrelated checkout Git hint appeared in the logs, but no Node.js 20 deprecation warning was present.

## Post-Update Artifact Review Result

The uploaded artifact bundle for run `28157938343` was downloaded, inspected, and then removed from the local temp

## Retained Warnings

The retained warnings remain active and visible:

- bounded fixture Evidence is not full Todo app implementation
- partial UI screenshot/manual visual Evidence remains partial
- ACEP task-card public-doc cleanup remains deferred
- PR/push triggers and CI enforcement remain unapproved
- Node.js 20 deprecation annotation is resolved for the manual workflow by the Node 24 action/runtime update and
  successful post-update run `28157938343`; future GitHub Actions runtime changes remain ordinary CI hygiene
- CI pass is Evidence only and does not approve source authority change or user acceptance

## Source Authority Boundary

Tree-native selected-slice artifacts remain current operational source.

The reviewed aggregate-enabled CI-backed Evidence confirms a non-enforcing manual workflow run over declared read-model
Evidence artifacts. Todo Search remains the only scoped source-authority pilot. Todo App PBE Run remains structure-only.
The aggregate summary is Evidence-only over existing per-slice validation reports. This review does not change source
authority, approve full Graph-source promotion, retire tree-native or `.pbe` artifacts, replace user acceptance, add
branch protection, add PR/push triggers, or make the workflow a required check.

## Next Decision Surface

The next step should be one of:

1. `Keep aggregate-enabled workflow manual/non-enforcing and observe`
2. `Approve PR informational workflow implementation`
3. `Refine PR informational path filters before implementation`
4. `Design CI enforcement / required check policy`
5. `Require public-doc cleanup before broader promotion`
6. `Prepare broader Graph-source promotion review`
7. `Rollback / defer scoped source-authority pilot`

Recommended next step:

```text
Keep the aggregate-enabled workflow manual/non-enforcing and observe, or approve PR informational workflow implementation
if the user wants PR-visible Evidence now. Enforcement policy, cleanup, broader promotion review, and rollback/defer
remain separate major branches.
```

Follow-up status: multi-slice validation design, Todo Search profile extraction, Todo App structure-only profile,
per-slice independence, aggregate summary, and aggregate-enabled CI-backed run review are now recorded. This does not add
PR triggers, enforcement, `validate --all`, source authority expansion, or full promotion.

| Manual Workflow Run Gate         | pass   | Run `28156403793` completed successfully on `workflow_dispatch`.                                            |
| CI-Backed Artifact Review Gate   | pass   | Expanded artifact bundle `pbe-todo-search-read-model-evidence` was downloaded and inspected.                |
| CI Manifest Integrity Gate       | pass   | Manifest is `ci-backed` / `ci-evidence-pass` and includes Todo Search, Todo App, aggregate, and boundaries. |
| Validation Report Gate           | pass   | Todo Search and Todo App validation reports are `validation-pass` with 20 and 16 checks.                    |
| Parity Report Gate               | pass   | Todo Search parity is `comparison-pass`; Todo App parity remains `not-required`.                            |
| Aggregate Report Gate            | pass   | Aggregate summary is `aggregate-pass`, 2 slices, 0 warning/blocking/decision-required.                      |
| Non-Enforcing CI Gate            | pass   | Workflow remains manual and informational only.                                                             |
| Non-Required-Check Gate          | pass   | No required check or branch protection was added.                                                           |
| Source Authority Boundary Gate   | pass   | Source authority remains unchanged; Todo App remains structure-only.                                        |
| Non-Full-Promotion Gate          | pass   | No full Graph-source promotion is recorded.                                                                 |
| Scope Containment Gate           | pass   | Source-authority pilot remains bounded to Todo Search only.                                                 |
| Node 24 CI Hygiene Gate          | pass   | Run `28157938343` succeeded after the workflow moved to Node 24 action/runtime settings.                    |
| Retained Warning Visibility Gate | pass   | Retained Evidence/source warnings remain documented; Node.js 20 deprecation is no longer active.            |
| User Approval Boundary Gate      | pass   | CI pass is not treated as user approval.                                                                    |
| Evidence Honesty Gate            | pass   | Only the observed CI run and downloaded artifact are recorded as reviewed Evidence.                         |

## Final Statement

This review records successful non-enforcing aggregate-enabled CI-backed Evidence for the declared read-model Evidence
bundle. It does not promote Maintainability Graph, change current source authority, expand source-authority pilot scope,
introduce CI enforcement, add required checks, retire tree-native artifacts, clean up public docs, or replace user
approval.

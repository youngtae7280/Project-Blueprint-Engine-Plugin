# CI-Backed Read-Model Evidence Run Review

Status: ci-backed-read-model-evidence-run-review / e2e-smoke-manual-ci-reviewed /
non-enforcing-manual-run

## Review Purpose

This document records reviewed GitHub Actions runs for read-model Evidence, with the latest review covering the manual
workflow run after Todo App bounded non-authority projection-contract enrollment entered positive validate-all:

```text
DevView Read-Model Evidence
```

The purpose is to verify that a real CI-backed Evidence run exists, that its uploaded artifact bundle is reviewable, that
the aggregate-enabled manifest is internally consistent, and that source-authority and non-promotion boundaries are
preserved.

This review supersedes the earlier blocked attempt that could not dispatch the workflow because local GitHub CLI was not
authenticated. User-authenticated manual workflow runs are now available and reviewed.

The aggregate-enabled manual workflow run is reviewed in this document. A later Node 24 CI hygiene run confirms that the
workflow action/runtime update still produces the same aggregate Evidence result without the prior Node.js 20
deprecation annotation. The PR informational runs confirm that the non-enforcing `pull_request` trigger records PR
metadata and preserves Evidence-only boundaries. The latest manual and PR runs confirm that the workflow can use local
registry-backed `validate --all` while preserving the same artifact and boundary surface. PR #3 / run `28213236499`
also satisfies the observation policy's three-real-PR-run count threshold without changing path filters or enforcement.
The older Todo Search-only run remains as historical CI-backed Evidence for the first workflow shape.

## Boundary

This review is non-enforcing CI Evidence review only.

It does not:

- add branch protection
- create or require a PR check
- make the PR informational trigger required or enforcing
- add push or schedule triggers
- introduce CI enforcement
- change source authority
- expand the source-authority pilot scope beyond `examples/internal-legacy/adoption/todo-search-slice`
- make `examples/valid/todo-app-devview-run` parity-backed, pilot-marker-backed, or authority-bearing
- approve full Graph-source promotion
- perform public-doc cleanup
- retire tree-native artifacts
- hide retained warnings
- treat CI pass as user approval

The run was manually dispatched on `main`. It did not run as a PR check, push trigger, scheduled job, required check, or
branch-protection gate.

## Aggregate-Enabled Step Review Result

All relevant workflow steps completed successfully:

- Build CLI
- Generate Todo Search read-model Evidence
- Compare Todo Search generated and manual read-model Evidence
- Validate Todo Search read-model Evidence
- Generate Todo App DevView Run structure-only read-model Evidence
- Validate Todo App DevView Run structure-only read-model Evidence
- Summarize aggregate read-model Evidence
- Focused read-model Evidence tests
- Todo Search runtime fixture tests
- Validate PBE plugin files
- Validate PBE tree schemas
- Write CI evidence manifest
- Write evidence summary
- Upload read-model Evidence artifacts

GitHub emitted one maintenance annotation:

```text
Node.js 20 is deprecated. The following actions target Node.js 20 but are being forced to run on Node.js 24: actions/checkout@v4, actions/setup-node@v4, actions/upload-artifact@v4.
```

This annotation was a visible CI workflow maintenance warning, not a failed Evidence run. It did not block the reviewed
aggregate Evidence result. It was later addressed by updating the manual workflow to Node 24 action/runtime settings and
reviewing post-update run `28157938343`.

## Post-Update Node 24 CI Hygiene Run

After the workflow was updated to use `actions/checkout@v7`, `actions/setup-node@v6` with `node-version: 24`, and
`actions/upload-artifact@v7`, the manual workflow was dispatched again.

The run was manually dispatched on `main`. It did not run as a PR check, push trigger, scheduled job, required check, or
branch-protection gate.

All relevant workflow steps completed successfully, including Todo Search generation/comparison/validation, Todo App
PBE Run structure-only generation/validation, aggregate summarize, focused tests, runtime fixture tests, PBE validation,
CI manifest creation, step summary creation, and artifact upload.

Log review did not observe the prior Node.js 20 deprecation annotation after the Node 24 action/runtime update. An
unrelated checkout Git hint appeared in the logs, but no Node.js 20 deprecation warning was present.

## Post-Update Artifact Review Result

The uploaded artifact bundle for run `28157938343` was downloaded, inspected, and then removed from the local temp
workspace.

The run executed the validate-all-centered workflow through the `pull_request` trigger. All relevant steps completed
successfully, including `Validate all registry-backed read-model Evidence`, focused tests, runtime fixture tests, PBE
validation, CI manifest writing, Step Summary writing, and artifact upload.

### Third PR Artifact Review Result

Artifact:

```text
devview-todo-search-read-model-evidence
```

The artifact bundle was downloaded, reviewed, and removed from `.tmp/` after inspection. It contained the expected
positive read-model Evidence files:

- Todo Search generated read-model, evidence manifest, parity report, validation report, and scoped pilot marker
- Todo App DevView Run generated read-model, evidence manifest, and validation report
- aggregate summary JSON/Markdown
- CI evidence manifest

No invalid read-model fixture artifacts were included.

## Retained Warnings

The retained warnings remain active and visible:

- bounded fixture Evidence is not full Todo app implementation
- partial UI screenshot/manual visual Evidence remains partial
- ACEP task-card public-doc cleanup remains deferred
- push/schedule triggers, required checks, branch protection, and CI enforcement remain unapproved
- Node.js 20 deprecation annotation is resolved for the manual workflow by the Node 24 action/runtime update and
  successful post-update run `28157938343`; future GitHub Actions runtime changes remain ordinary CI hygiene
- PR #2 and PR #3 were smoke PRs; they satisfy the run-count threshold but should still be interpreted as docs-path
  observation, not automatic path-filter refinement or enforcement approval
- CI pass is Evidence only and does not approve source authority change or user acceptance

## Source Authority Boundary

Tree-native selected-slice artifacts remain current operational source.

The reviewed validate-all CI-backed Evidence confirms both a non-enforcing manual workflow run and non-enforcing
`pull_request` informational runs over the declared registry profiles and read-model Evidence artifacts. PR #2 and PR #3
confirm that the validate-all-centered workflow records PR metadata, `pull_request-informational` trigger mode,
`validateAllStatus: aggregate-pass`, and Evidence boundaries. Todo Search remains the only scoped source-authority pilot.
Todo App DevView Run remains structure-only. Invalid fixtures remain local-only and are not part of the positive aggregate
path. The aggregate summary is Evidence-only over produced per-slice validation reports. This review does not change
source authority, approve full Graph-source promotion, retire tree-native or `.devview` artifacts, replace user acceptance,
add branch protection, add push/schedule triggers, or make the workflow a required check.

## Next Decision Surface

The next step should be one of:

1. `Design PR informational path-filter / failure-semantics refinement`
2. `Keep PR informational workflow non-enforcing and continue observing`
3. `Design CI enforcement / required check policy`
4. `Require public-doc cleanup before broader promotion`
5. `Prepare broader Graph-source promotion review`
6. `Rollback / defer scoped source-authority pilot`

Recommended next step:

```text
The three-real-PR observation count is now satisfied. Keep the PR informational workflow non-enforcing, and consider a
separate path-filter / failure-semantics refinement decision surface next. Enforcement policy, cleanup, broader
promotion review, and rollback/defer remain separate major branches.
```

Follow-up status: multi-slice validation design, Todo Search profile extraction, Todo App structure-only profile,
per-slice independence, aggregate summary, aggregate-enabled CI-backed run review, PR informational trigger
implementation, local validate-all, and validate-all-switched manual CI review are now recorded. This does not add
enforcement, source authority expansion, or full promotion; the validate-all PR observations now include PR #2 / run
`28210904900` and PR #3 / run `28213236499`.

The observation policy for later PR informational runs is recorded in
[pr-informational-observation-policy.md](pr-informational-observation-policy.md). Future PR run notes should use that
policy before changing path filters, failure semantics, required-check policy, or validation scope.

The append-only observation log and runbook for repeatable future PR run review is recorded in
[pr-informational-observation-log.md](pr-informational-observation-log.md). It records the manual baseline run
`28207696557`, PR `#1` run `28207822252`, PR `#2` run `28210904900`, PR `#3` run `28213236499`, PR `#4` run
`28218854329`, and the template/checklist for future observations without changing workflow triggers or enforcement.

## Projection-Contract CI Capture Review

Manual run `28218687289` reviewed the validate-all workflow after CI began capturing graph-source projection contract
status.

Manual workflow run `28423595270` reviewed the workflow after the PBE operation-chain dogfood reports were added to
non-enforcing CI observation. Earlier run `28423430000` exposed Linux portability/BOM parsing gaps in the new
operation-chain step; commit `c407bff` fixed record discovery, nested PowerShell invocation, and BOM-tolerant manifest
parsing before this successful rerun.

## Final Statement

This review records successful non-enforcing validate-all CI-backed Evidence for the declared read-model Evidence
bundle. It does not promote Maintainability Graph, change current source authority, expand source-authority pilot scope,
introduce CI enforcement, add required checks, retire tree-native artifacts, clean up public docs, or replace user
approval.

# CI-Backed Read-Model Evidence Run Review

Status: ci-backed-read-model-evidence-run-review / ci-evidence-pass-reviewed / non-enforcing-manual-run

## Review Purpose

This document records the reviewed GitHub Actions run for Todo Search read-model Evidence:

```text
PBE Read-Model Evidence
```

The purpose is to verify that a real CI-backed Evidence run exists, that its uploaded artifact bundle is reviewable, and
that its CI manifest preserves source-authority and non-promotion boundaries.

This review supersedes the earlier blocked attempt that could not dispatch the workflow because local GitHub CLI was not
authenticated. A user-authenticated manual workflow run is now available and reviewed.

## Boundary

This review is non-enforcing CI Evidence review only.

It does not:

- add branch protection
- create or require a PR check
- add PR or push triggers
- introduce CI enforcement
- change source authority
- expand the pilot scope beyond `examples/adoption/todo-search-slice`
- approve full Graph-source promotion
- perform public-doc cleanup
- retire tree-native artifacts
- hide retained warnings
- treat CI pass as user approval

## Retained Warnings

The retained warnings remain active and visible:

- bounded fixture Evidence is not full Todo app implementation
- partial UI screenshot/manual visual Evidence remains partial
- ACEP task-card public-doc cleanup remains deferred
- PR/push triggers and CI enforcement remain unapproved
- CI pass is Evidence only and does not approve source authority change or user acceptance

## Source Authority Boundary

Tree-native selected-slice artifacts remain current operational source.

The reviewed CI-backed Evidence confirms a non-enforcing manual workflow run for the Todo Search selected slice. It does
not change source authority, approve full Graph-source promotion, retire tree-native artifacts, replace user acceptance,
add branch protection, add PR/push triggers, or make the workflow a required check.

## Next Decision Surface

The next step should be one of:

1. `Keep workflow manual/non-enforcing and observe`
2. `Design PR informational trigger`
3. `Design CI enforcement / required check policy`
4. `Prepare multi-slice validation design`
5. `Require public-doc cleanup before broader promotion`
6. `Prepare broader Graph-source promotion review`
7. `Rollback / defer scoped source-authority pilot`

Recommended next step:

```text
Keep workflow manual/non-enforcing and observe, unless the user wants the next major branch: PR informational trigger, enforcement policy, multi-slice validation, cleanup, broader promotion review, or rollback/defer.
```

Follow-up status: multi-slice validation design is now recorded, the first implementation step extracted an explicit Todo
Search `SliceReadModelConfig` profile without intended behavior change, and `examples/valid/todo-app-pbe-run` is now
implemented as a second `structure-only` profile/fixture. This does not alter the reviewed CI-backed run result, which
still applies only to Todo Search, and it does not add PR triggers, enforcement, CI-backed Evidence for the second
fixture, `validate --all`, or source authority expansion. Both local validation reports now carry per-slice independence
metadata, and the first aggregate summary reads them as separate Evidence units without treating the Todo Search CI run
as evidence for the second fixture.

## Final Statement

This review records successful non-enforcing CI-backed Evidence for the Todo Search selected slice. It does not promote
Maintainability Graph, change current source authority, expand pilot scope, introduce CI enforcement, add required
checks, retire tree-native artifacts, clean up public docs, or replace user approval.

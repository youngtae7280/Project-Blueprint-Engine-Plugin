# CLI-Backed Read-Model Evidence Output Design

Status: cli-backed-read-model-evidence-output-design / design-approved-to-draft / implementation-not-started

## Document Purpose

This document defines the concept-level output design for future generated / CLI-backed read-model Evidence before
actual scoped source-authority pilot execution can be reconsidered for the Todo Search selected slice.

It designs the future evidence output shape, command surface candidates, comparison rules, mismatch report expectations,
and review labels.

It does not implement anything and does not create generated Evidence.

## Design Purpose

[generated-read-model-evidence-requirement.md](generated-read-model-evidence-requirement.md) records that generated /
CLI-backed read-model Evidence is required before actual scoped source-authority pilot execution can be reconsidered.

This design defines what that future Evidence should look like and how it should be reviewed.

It does not:

- implement a command
- implement a builder
- implement a parser
- define a schema or TypeScript model
- create generated output
- validate source authority
- approve scoped execution

## Future Command / Surface Concept

The command names below are conceptual candidates only. They are not implemented commands and not committed CLI API.

| Conceptual surface                                                          | Purpose                                                                                  | Source inputs                                                                                                     | Output artifact                                                            | Required for scoped pilot?                                     | Future full promotion role                                            | Non-authority boundary                                                              |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pbe graph read-model generate --slice examples/adoption/todo-search-slice` | Generate a read-model Evidence artifact from declared selected-slice inputs.             | Product/Project/Work/Test/Evidence/Acceptance, Change/Impact, contracts, runtime Evidence, warnings.              | `generated-read-model.json`, `generated-read-model.md`, optional manifest. | Yes, if user keeps generated output as execution prerequisite. | Possible input to broader generator design, not sufficient by itself. | Generates Evidence only; does not switch source authority.                          |
| `pbe graph read-model compare --generated <file> --manual <file>`           | Compare generated output against the manual read-model parity artifact.                  | Generated read-model artifact and current manual parity artifact / View Instance Manifest.                        | `read-model-parity-report.json`, `read-model-parity-report.md`.            | Yes, if manual parity remains the review baseline.             | Possible future validator input if later approved.                    | Reports mismatch only; does not auto-fix source or manual artifacts.                |
| `pbe evidence read-model --slice examples/adoption/todo-search-slice`       | Produce an Evidence-oriented manifest summarizing run identity, source inputs, warnings. | Same selected-slice inputs plus command/test Evidence references and Approval Brief / Evidence exception records. | `read-model-evidence-manifest.json` or equivalent summary.                 | Helpful but not necessarily sufficient alone.                  | Possible CI/reporting input if later approved.                        | Evidence manifest only; not source, not acceptance, not source-transition approval. |

The future design may combine these surfaces into one command or keep them separate. That implementation choice remains
open until a later approved implementation task.

## Output Artifact Design

These artifacts are conceptual outputs. They should not be treated as existing files until a later implementation task
creates them.

| Artifact candidate                  | Role                                                                                     | Required metadata                                                                                           | Required content / sections                                                                                                   | Source authority boundary                                                       | Review status labels                                                                |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `generated-read-model.json`         | Machine-readable generated read-model Evidence.                                          | timestamp, command identity, source commit, source slice, input artifact list, generation mode, run id.     | nodes with `nodeKind`, edges with `edgeType`, source references, view memberships, role tags, confidence/freshness, warnings. | Evidence only; cannot become source without explicit scoped execution approval. | `generated-present`, `generated-missing`, `generated-stale`, `generated-partial`.   |
| `generated-read-model.md`           | Human-readable explanation of generated output.                                          | same run identity metadata, source boundary statement, non-promotion statement.                             | source summary, node/edge summary, 7 Core View summary, Check/Evidence summary, warning summary, limitations.                 | Review summary only; not source authority.                                      | `generated-present`, `generated-partial`, `decision-required`.                      |
| `read-model-parity-report.json`     | Machine-readable generated/manual comparison report.                                     | generated artifact id, manual artifact id, comparison timestamp, source commit, comparison rule version.    | comparable units, mismatch list, severity, affected nodes/edges/views/warnings, control node candidates.                      | Reports mismatch only; does not update source or manual artifact.               | `comparison-pass`, `comparison-warning`, `comparison-blocked`, `decision-required`. |
| `read-model-parity-report.md`       | Human-readable comparison report for Approval Brief / Control Node review.               | same comparison metadata, non-authority statement.                                                          | summary, mismatch table, severity explanation, user judgment items, recommended blockers/warnings/defer candidates.           | Review report only; not source authority.                                       | `comparison-pass`, `comparison-warning`, `comparison-blocked`, `decision-required`. |
| `read-model-evidence-manifest.json` | Optional Evidence manifest tying generated output to source inputs and command Evidence. | run identity, input artifact hashes or references if later supported, command/test Evidence refs, warnings. | Evidence references, input list, generated output refs, comparison refs, retained warnings, gate status summary.              | Evidence index only; not source, not Acceptance, not promotion.                 | `generated-present`, `generated-partial`, `decision-required`.                      |

## Required Output Fields / Sections

Future generated output should include these fields or sections at concept level:

- run identity: timestamp, command identity, source commit, source slice, input artifact list
- source input references
- generated node list with `nodeKind`
- generated edge list with `edgeType`
- role tags restricted to allowed `viewScopedTags`
- view membership separated from tags
- 7 Core View coverage summary
- confidence vs freshness/status separation
- Check/Evidence mapping summary
- retained warnings and Evidence exceptions
- compatibility warning carry-forward
- source authority boundary statement
- generated/manual comparison summary
- mismatch list with category and severity
- Control Node candidate summary
- final non-promotion / non-authority statement

## Comparison / Parity Design

Generated output should be compared to the current manual parity artifact, but neither side should silently update the
other.

Comparable units:

- node id and `nodeKind`
- edge source, target, and `edgeType`
- source references
- view memberships
- role tags
- confidence and freshness/status
- warnings and Evidence exceptions
- source authority boundary statement
- 7 Core View coverage
- Check/Evidence mappings

Mismatch categories:

| Category                    | Meaning                                                                    | Example treatment                                                             |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| missing node                | Generated output omits a manual or source-required durable target.         | Warning or blocking depending on source/acceptance impact.                    |
| missing edge                | Generated output omits a required semantic relationship.                   | Warning or decision-required if traceability is affected.                     |
| wrong role tag              | Generated output uses invalid tag or confuses view membership with tags.   | Blocking for taxonomy/view integrity if invalid role tags appear.             |
| stale/freshness mismatch    | Generated output differs from known Evidence freshness.                    | Evidence Control Node candidate; decision-required if acceptance is affected. |
| source reference mismatch   | Generated output references the wrong source or lacks source traceability. | Blocking if source/fallback boundary becomes unclear.                         |
| warning omission            | Generated output hides retained warnings or Evidence exceptions.           | Blocking or decision-required depending on risk.                              |
| authority-boundary mismatch | Generated output implies source switch, promotion, or tree retirement.     | Blocking; Decision/Compatibility/Impact Control Node candidate.               |

Severity labels:

| Severity            | Meaning                                                                                        |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `info`              | Difference is explanatory or does not affect review judgment.                                  |
| `warning`           | Difference should be visible but may not block scoped execution discussion.                    |
| `blocking`          | Difference blocks scoped execution approval until fixed, deferred, or explicitly accepted.     |
| `decision-required` | Difference affects source, acceptance, risk, authority, or compatibility and needs user input. |

Treatment rules:

- mismatch never auto-fixes source artifacts
- mismatch never silently updates the manual artifact
- mismatch affecting source/acceptance/risk/authority requires user judgment
- mismatch may create Evidence, Impact, Compatibility, or Decision Control Node candidates
- mismatch must remain visible in Approval Brief or equivalent review surface when it affects user judgment

## Evidence Status Labels

These are concept labels, not schema enums:

| Label                | Meaning                                                                          |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `generated-present`  | Generated output exists for the declared source inputs.                          |
| `generated-missing`  | Required generated output does not exist.                                        |
| `generated-stale`    | Generated output exists but may not reflect current inputs.                      |
| `generated-partial`  | Generated output exists but omits required inputs, views, warnings, or mappings. |
| `comparison-pass`    | Generated/manual comparison has no blocking or decision-required mismatch.       |
| `comparison-warning` | Comparison has visible non-blocking warnings.                                    |
| `comparison-blocked` | Comparison has blocking mismatch.                                                |
| `decision-required`  | Comparison or output affects a user judgment boundary.                           |

## Gate Relationship

### Evidence Gate

The output design clarifies what generated Evidence must show. Future generated output can satisfy part of the Evidence
gate if it is present, fresh, source-linked, warning-preserving, and comparable.

### Authority Gate

Generated output can support authority readiness by making source/fallback comparisons repeatable. It does not activate
source authority.

### Rollback / Fallback Gate

Generated/manual comparison can help identify fallback mismatch. It does not define rollback mechanics or make
rollback-ready status true by itself.

### Compatibility Gate

Generated output must carry compatibility warnings forward. It does not clean up public docs or retire compatibility
views.

### Approval Gate

Generated output may support a later user decision. It does not approve scoped execution, source transition, Acceptance,
or full promotion.

## Non-Scope

This design does not include:

- implementation
- generated file creation
- actual CLI command
- parser implementation
- schema/type model
- validator/CI
- source authority change
- Graph-source promotion
- public-doc cleanup
- tree-native retirement
- actual scoped source-authority pilot execution

## Recommended Next User Decision Surface

After this design, the user must choose one of:

1. `Approve generated read-model builder implementation task`
2. `Refine output design before implementation`
3. `Require validator/CI design first`
4. `Require public-doc cleanup before implementation`
5. `Defer generated builder work`
6. `Reject scoped source-authority pilot path`

Recommended option:

```text
Approve generated read-model builder implementation task
```

Reason:

- The output shape, candidate command surfaces, comparison units, mismatch categories, severity labels, and gate
  boundaries are now defined at concept level.
- The design explicitly prevents generated output from becoming source authority by itself.
- Validator/CI can remain a later stronger Evidence level unless the user wants to raise the gate before scoped pilot
  work.

If the user wants stricter repeatability before any implementation, choose `Require validator/CI design first` instead.

## Approval Brief Draft

### Intent Understood

PBE is defining the future CLI-backed/generated read-model Evidence output design before any builder or CLI work starts.

### Result Summary

The design proposes conceptual command surfaces, output artifacts, required fields/sections, generated/manual comparison
rules, mismatch categories, severity labels, Evidence status labels, gate relationships, and non-scope boundaries.

### Verification Summary

| ------------------------------- | ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| User selected design-first path | present      | Parent orchestration chat selected `Prepare CLI-backed evidence output design first`.          |
| Requirement basis               | present      | `generated-read-model-evidence-requirement.md` defines generated Evidence prerequisite.        |
| Command/surface concept         | present      | Conceptual command candidates are named without committing CLI API or implementation.          |
| Output artifact design          | present      | Generated artifact, summary, comparison report, and optional manifest roles are defined.       |
| Comparison / parity design      | present      | Comparable units, mismatch categories, severities, and treatment rules are defined.            |
| Generated output                | missing      | No generated output is created by this design.                                                 |
| Source authority change         | not approved | Generated output, when later implemented, will still be Evidence rather than automatic source. |
| Validator/CI linkage            | open         | Validator/CI-backed Evidence remains a stronger future level.                                  |

### Remaining Judgment

The user must decide whether to approve an implementation task, refine the design, require validator/CI design first,
require public-doc cleanup first, defer, or reject the scoped pilot path.

### Approval Choice Candidates

- `Approve generated read-model builder implementation task`
- `Refine output design before implementation`
- `Require validator/CI design first`
- `Require public-doc cleanup before implementation`
- `Defer generated builder work`
- `Reject scoped source-authority pilot path`

### State Label

```text
Decision required
```

Reason: output design is drafted, but implementation and generated Evidence are not approved or created.

| Demo-support Acceptance with warning | Acceptance Control Node      | closed with warnings               | Demo-support acceptance remains separate from source-transition approval.                     |
| Generated/manual mismatch handling   | Evidence / Decision Control  | design-defined / execution pending | Future mismatches may create Evidence, Impact, Compatibility, or Decision Control candidates. |

| Source Authority Boundary Gate          | PASS   | Generated output remains Evidence unless a later explicit source transition approves otherwise.   |
| User Approval Gate                      | PASS   | Implementation and scoped execution still require later explicit user decisions.                  |

## Final Statement

This design does not implement CLI-backed output.

It does not create generated Evidence.

It does not approve or execute scoped source-authority transition.

It does not change current source authority, retire tree-native artifacts, or declare Graph-source promotion.

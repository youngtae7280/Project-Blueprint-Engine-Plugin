# Contract Compiler Dry-Run v0.1

Status: implemented / deterministic candidate compiler / generated-vs-hand-written diff / local non-enforcing report

## Purpose

The Contract Fixture Validator answers: "Is this contract-shaped artifact safe?"

The Compiler Input Model answers: "Are the inputs grounded in graph, policy, Evidence, and bounded vocabulary?"

Contract Compiler Dry-Run v0.1 answers the next narrow question:

"Can PBE deterministically compile one contract candidate from those validated inputs, then send that candidate back
through the Contract Fixture Validator and compare it against the hand-written dry-run fixture?"

## Current Scope

The current dry-run compiler supports only the committed Todo Search whitespace-normalization `bug_fix` fixture:

- input: `examples/internal-legacy/read-model-aggregate/generated/compiler-input-model-dry-run.json`
- output candidate: `examples/internal-legacy/read-model-aggregate/generated/execution-contract-dry-run.generated.json`
- hand-written comparison target: `examples/internal-legacy/read-model-aggregate/generated/execution-contract-dry-run.json`
- diff report: `examples/internal-legacy/read-model-aggregate/generated/execution-contract-dry-run.diff.json`
- validator: `validateExecutionContract`

The local command is:

```powershell
node dist/cli/index.js graph read-model compile-contract --dry-run --json
```

## Deterministic Mapping

The compiler candidate is derived without AI prose:

- `humanRequest.text` becomes `goal`.
- `packSchema.changeType` becomes `changeType`.
- `targetScopeCandidates[]` becomes `allowedScope[]`.
- `graphSnapshot.artifacts[]` becomes `requiredContext[]`.
- `policySnapshot.evidenceCheckMappings[]` maps `evidenceIndex.entries[]` into `requiredEvidence[]`.
- `policySnapshot.forbiddenScopeRules[]` becomes `forbiddenScope[]`.
- fixed local checks cover runtime fixture, validate-all, health report, and E2E smoke.

After compilation, the candidate must pass the existing Contract Fixture Validator. A candidate that does not validate is
blocked and is not treated as executable.

The compiler-produced candidate uses `sourceMode: contract-compiler-dry-run-v0`. The hand-written fixture keeps
`sourceMode: compiler-boundary-mvp-dry-run`, so the diff report is expected to show the intentional boundary between the
manual fixture and the compiler-produced candidate.

## Diff Report

The diff report is review Evidence only. It compares the generated candidate with the hand-written dry-run contract
across contract-level fields such as source mode, scopes, context, checks, Evidence, risks, stop conditions, and output
requirements.

Expected current status:

- `candidateStatus`: `contract-candidate-pass`
- `candidateDiff.status`: `contract-diff-detected`
- `candidateDiff.reviewStatus`: `non-blocking-review-diff`
- `candidateDiff.equivalenceStatus`: `compiler-equivalence-not-proven`
- `candidateDiff.differingFields`: visible fields to review before relying on the generated candidate

`contract-compiler-dry-run-pass` means the compiler candidate was produced and passed the Contract Fixture Validator.
It does not mean the compiler-produced candidate is semantically equivalent to the hand-written contract. While
`candidateDiff.status` remains `contract-diff-detected`, the generated candidate is reviewable but equivalence is not
proven.

The diff report keeps field-level status and id-based summaries for:

- `allowedScope`
- `forbiddenScope`
- `requiredContext`
- `requiredChecks`
- `requiredEvidence`
- `knownRisks`
- `stopConditions`

The diff report now also classifies those id-based differences as semantic review metadata:

- `semanticDiffs[]`
- `semanticClassificationCounts`
- `highestReviewSeverity`
- `compilerPromotionReadiness`
- `semanticDiffRuleCoverage`
- `equivalencePolicy`

Dry-run v0.1 classifications are small fixture-specific rules, not a general policy engine. Earlier Todo Search
whitespace-normalization diffs classified missing required Evidence as `semantic-loss` and missing forbidden scope as
`policy-loss`; v0.2 source-authority resolvers now preserve those fields for the current fixture. The generated
candidate remains review-only because non-semantic review differences still exist, but allowed scope no longer carries
conservative source-authority review debt. This status is review metadata only; it does not enable promotion, required
checks, branch protection, or execution.

Each semantic diff records the `matchedRuleId` that produced its classification. Differences without a dedicated v0.1
rule use `matchedRuleId: semantic-diff-rule-unknown`, classify as `unknown-review-required`, and prevent promotion
readiness. `compilerPromotionReadiness` is derived from the semantic diffs; it is not a manually asserted status.

Current triage previously classified `outputRequirements` as `output-requirement-loss`. v0.2 now derives generated
`outputRequirements` from `outputRequirementSources[]`, so the current generated candidate preserves the changed-file,
command-output Evidence, validation-result, and boundary reporting obligations for this fixture. `sourceMode` and
`nonExecutionStatement` are classified as `metadata-only`; `requiredEvidence`, `forbiddenScope`, `stopConditions`,
`requiredContext`, `knownRisks`, and `allowedScope` are preserved from source authority. Unknown diffs remain possible
for future fields, but the current dry-run diff set is fully classified.

The diff artifact now also includes an equivalence/readiness policy summary:

- `sourceAuthorityPreservationStatus: source-authority-preserved`
- `semanticDiffPolicyStatus: semantic-diff-clean`
- `reviewOnlyDiffStatus: review-only-diff-detected`
- `blockingSemanticLossCount: 0`
- `reviewOnlyDiffCount: 3`
- `equivalenceCandidate: true`
- `equivalenceProven: false`

This separates "major fields are source-authority preserved" from "equivalence is proven." The current candidate is an
equivalence candidate for review only; it is not an execution source.

## v0.1 Closeout

v0.1 proves:

- Compiler Input Model data can produce a deterministic contract candidate.
- The generated candidate can be revalidated by the Contract Fixture Validator.
- The generated candidate can be compared against the hand-written dry-run contract.
- Diff fields can be classified through explicit semantic diff rules.
- Current semantic diff unknown coverage is zero: `semantic-diff-unknowns-zero`.
- Promotion readiness is derived from semantic diffs, not asserted manually.

v0.1 does not prove:

- semantic equivalence with the hand-written contract;
- execution readiness;
- output requirement preservation;
- policy, Evidence, check, or source-authority completeness;
- support for arbitrary `changeType` values.

The current closeout status is `contract-compiler-dry-run-v0.1-classification-complete`, but
`equivalenceProven` remains `false` and `compilerPromotionReadiness` remains `compiler-promotion-review-required`
because the generated candidate still differs from the hand-written fixture in review-only fields such as source mode,
check set, and non-execution wording. The v0.2 policy summary marks this as `equivalenceCandidate: true`, while keeping
`equivalenceProven: false` until a later approved equivalence policy and human review explicitly promote it.

## Boundaries

This is not an executor.

This dry-run does not:

- execute AI;
- perform the requested code change;
- apply graph deltas;
- approve or accept work;
- enable required checks;
- configure branch protection;
- retire tree-native artifacts;
- support arbitrary change types.

It only proves the first closed loop:

```text
Compiler Input Model
-> deterministic contract candidate
-> Contract Fixture Validator
-> generated-vs-hand-written diff report
```

## v0.2 Source-Authority Reconstruction

The next layer should not be an executor. The recommended v0.2 candidate is Output Requirement Source Authority, or a
broader source-authority resolver, so the compiler can reconstruct output requirements from graph, policy, Evidence,
and check sources instead of replacing execution-result reporting obligations with compiler self-reporting. Pack schema
expansion should wait until that source-authority path is clearer.

The first v0.2 preview is now recorded in
[output-requirement-source-authority.md](output-requirement-source-authority.md) and emitted as:

```text
examples/internal-legacy/read-model-aggregate/generated/output-requirement-source-authority.preview.json
```

This surface maps hand-written output obligations to `outputRequirementSources[]` for comparison and now uses those
source authority entries to derive generated `outputRequirements`. The current preview reports
`generated-output-requirements-preserved` with zero unresolved output obligations. The compiler also derives
`forbiddenScope[]` from `policySnapshot.forbiddenScopeRules[]`, so the current fixture no longer carries
forbidden-scope policy-loss. It also derives `stopConditions[]` from `stopConditionSources[]`, so the current fixture no
longer carries stop-condition policy-loss. Finally, it derives `requiredEvidence[]` from `evidenceIndex.entries[]` plus
`policySnapshot.evidenceCheckMappings[]`, so the current fixture no longer carries required-Evidence semantic loss or
evidence-chain mismatch. It now derives `requiredContext[]` from `graphSnapshot.artifacts[]`, so the current fixture no
longer carries required-context semantic loss. It now derives `knownRisks[]` from `riskSources[]`, so the current
fixture no longer carries known-risk semantic loss. It now derives `allowedScope[]` from `targetScopeCandidates[]`, so
the current fixture no longer carries allowed-scope conservative review debt. This still does not prove full
equivalence because review-only diffs remain.

The remaining-loss preview is recorded in
[contract-source-authority-gap-preview.md](contract-source-authority-gap-preview.md) and emitted as:

```text
examples/internal-legacy/read-model-aggregate/generated/contract-source-authority-gap.preview.json
```

It explains source-authority gaps by field and currently recommends `none` for the current fixture because allowed scope
is also preserved from source authority. The policy forbidden-scope, stop-condition, Evidence, context, risk, and
allowed-scope resolvers are intentionally narrow: they derive generated fields from committed source authority entries,
not from the hand-written comparison fixture.

## v0.2 Current-Fixture Closeout

For the current Todo Search whitespace-normalization `bug_fix` dry-run fixture, v0.2 now proves the narrow
source-authority reconstruction loop:

- generated `outputRequirements` are derived from `outputRequirementSources[]`;
- generated `forbiddenScope` is derived from `policySnapshot.forbiddenScopeRules[]`;
- generated `stopConditions` are derived from `stopConditionSources[]`;
- generated `requiredEvidence` is derived from `evidenceIndex.entries[]` and `policySnapshot.evidenceCheckMappings[]`;
- generated `requiredContext` is derived from `graphSnapshot.artifacts[]`;
- generated `knownRisks` are derived from `riskSources[]`;
- generated `allowedScope` is derived from `targetScopeCandidates[]`;
- remaining semantic/policy/source-authority loss is zero for this fixture;
- the current generated candidate is an `equivalenceCandidate` for review.

The first human decision record for this fixture is
[contract-compiler-promotion-decision-current-fixture.md](contract-compiler-promotion-decision-current-fixture.md). It
records `approved-for-current-fixture-promotion-review` for the current Todo Search dry-run fixture, current generated
candidate, and current promotion review packet only.

v0.2 does not prove:

- semantic equivalence for future fixtures;
- support for arbitrary `changeType` values;
- executor or implementation readiness;
- CI enforcement or required-check readiness;
- graph delta application;
- user acceptance;
- tree-native retirement readiness;
- that the generated compiler candidate should become broadly authoritative.

`equivalenceProven` remains `false` because the approved decision is scoped to current-fixture promotion review, not to
broad equivalence proof. Generated `approvalStatus` remains unchanged because no machine-readable promotion status
policy has been approved for reflecting docs-only human decision records into generated artifacts.

## v0.2 Equivalence/Readiness Policy

The current next layer is not another resolver. It is the review policy recorded in
[contract-compiler-equivalence-policy.md](contract-compiler-equivalence-policy.md).

That policy keeps these states separate:

- `source-authority-preserved`
- `semantic-diff-clean`
- `review-only-diff-detected`
- `equivalence-candidate`
- `compiler-promotion-review-required`
- `equivalence-proven`

`equivalenceProven` is not set to `true` in this stage, even if a future fixture reaches a field match. Equivalence proof
requires an explicitly approved policy and human review. The current dry-run remains non-enforcing review Evidence.

## v0.2 Promotion Review Packet

The promotion review boundary is recorded in
[contract-compiler-promotion-review-policy.md](contract-compiler-promotion-review-policy.md). `equivalenceCandidate`
means the current candidate is ready to be reviewed, not that it has been approved or accepted.

`graph read-model compile-contract --dry-run --json` now also emits:

```text
examples/internal-legacy/read-model-aggregate/generated/contract-compiler-promotion-review.preview.json
```

The packet references the generated candidate, hand-written comparison fixture, semantic diff artifact, output
requirement source-authority preview, and source-authority gap preview. It includes validation commands, review-only diff
summary, explicit non-goals, and a human checklist. The current packet status is
`promotion-review-ready-for-human`, while `approvalStatus` remains `not-approved` and `equivalenceProven` remains
`false`.

The current review-only diffs are now narrowed into:

- `source-mode-metadata-only`;
- `validation-superset-review-only`;
- `boundary-wording-review-required`.

`boundary-wording-review-required` remains a human-review item because boundary wording must preserve non-execution,
non-approval, non-enforcement, no user-acceptance, and no graph-delta-apply meanings before any later promotion
decision.

The optional decision template is:

```text
docs/templates/contract-compiler-promotion-decision.md
```

The template is for human decision records. It is not an automatic approval mechanism. The first docs-only current
fixture decision record is
[contract-compiler-promotion-decision-current-fixture.md](contract-compiler-promotion-decision-current-fixture.md).

## Next Milestone

The next milestone is not executor automation. The recommended next step is selecting a second fixture or calibration
fixture with a different contract shape, then observing whether source-authority reconstruction generalizes beyond the
current Todo Search `bug_fix` fixture.

The selected second/calibration fixture is recorded in
[contract-compiler-calibration-fixtures.md](contract-compiler-calibration-fixtures.md). The selected candidate is the
`component/escape-html` Symbol stringification behavior-change dogfood because it is an existing external retrofit
fixture with graph source, instruction pack, graph delta, graph update proposal, and external project test Evidence. The
selection is planning-only: it does not mark the second fixture as supported, does not generalize the current human
decision, and does not approve execution or enforcement.

The next milestone should:

- design a bounded Compiler Input Model candidate for the selected second fixture;
- model compiler inputs for that fixture;
- run the non-executing compiler dry-run loop;
- observe which source-authority resolvers fail, remain sufficient, or require extension;
- keep promotion review non-enforcing;
- keep generated compiler output out of execution authority;
- avoid changing `pbe`, `.pbe`, validation scripts, generated artifact paths, sourceMode values, or compatibility
  namespaces.

That observation should determine the v0.3 scope. It should not begin with AI executor automation, graph delta apply,
required checks, branch protection, user acceptance automation, or tree-native retirement.

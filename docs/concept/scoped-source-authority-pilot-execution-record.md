# Scoped Source-Authority Pilot Execution Record

Status: scoped-source-authority-pilot-execution-record / scoped-pilot-executed-with-fallback-ready / bounded-to-todo-search

## Document Purpose

This record documents the user-approved actual scoped source-authority pilot execution for the Todo Search selected
slice.

This is a bounded pilot execution record. It is not full Graph-source promotion, not repository-wide source authority
change, not public-doc cleanup, not validator/CI enforcement, and not tree-native artifact retirement.

## Pilot Scope

### Primary Pilot Scope

```text
examples/internal-legacy/adoption/todo-search-slice
```

The pilot applies only to the Todo Search selected slice and its generated Evidence outputs.

### Generated Evidence Input

- `examples/internal-legacy/adoption/todo-search-slice/generated/generated-read-model.json`
- `examples/internal-legacy/adoption/todo-search-slice/generated/read-model-evidence-manifest.json`
- `examples/internal-legacy/adoption/todo-search-slice/generated/read-model-parity-report.json`
- `examples/internal-legacy/adoption/todo-search-slice/generated/parity-warning-resolution.md`

### Manual / Reference Inputs

- tree-native selected-slice artifacts under `examples/internal-legacy/adoption/todo-search-slice`
- `examples/internal-legacy/adoption/todo-search-slice/maintainability-graph-read-model.json`
- `examples/internal-legacy/adoption/todo-search-slice/view-instance-manifest.json`

### Supplemental Warning Only

```text
examples/internal-legacy/adoption/compatibility-mismatch-slice
```

The compatibility mismatch slice remains warning Evidence only. It is not pilot source scope.

## Source-Authority Pilot Meaning

For this pilot only, the generated read-model output is accepted as the bounded Graph-first interpretation record for:

- Node/Edge/Tag interpretation of the Todo Search selected slice
- 7 Core View assembly and traversal
- generated/manual parity review
- Approval Brief and Control Node review preparation
- scoped source-transition observation inside the Todo Search slice

This pilot authority is limited, reversible, and dependent on:

- generated Evidence being present
- the generated/manual parity report being `comparison-pass`
- retained warnings remaining visible
- tree-native fallback/reference artifacts being preserved
- user acceptance authority remaining user-controlled

## What Does Not Become Authoritative

The pilot does not make these authoritative:

- full Maintainability Graph source model
- repository-wide graph source authority
- public docs or ACEP cleanup state
- supplemental compatibility mismatch slice
- validator/CI enforcement
- generated builder output outside the Todo Search selected slice
- Codex/PBE self-acceptance

## Fallback / Rollback Criteria

No rollback command is executed in this record because no tree-native artifact is retired and no repository-wide source
authority is changed.

Fallback to tree-native selected-slice artifacts is required if any of these occur:

- generated/manual parity report becomes `comparison-warning`, `comparison-blocked`, or `decision-required`
- generated output loses source references or Node/Edge/Tag taxonomy integrity
- source authority boundary text is missing or implies broader promotion
- retained warnings are hidden
- Check/Evidence separation becomes ambiguous
- user acceptance authority appears replaced by Codex/PBE
- compatibility mismatch affects current scope, verification, acceptance, or authority judgment

Fallback is user-visible. It must not silently rewrite generated output, manual parity artifacts, or tree-native
selected-slice artifacts.

## Retained Warnings

| Warning                                      | Pilot treatment                                                                 |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Bounded fixture Evidence                     | Acceptable for this scoped pilot; not full Todo app implementation.             |
| Partial UI screenshot/manual visual Evidence | Acceptable warning for this pilot; visual proof remains partial.                |
| Validator/CI-backed Evidence missing         | Future strengthening question; not required for this scoped pilot execution.    |
| ACEP task-card public-doc cleanup deferred   | Deferred cleanup; visible compatibility warning, not performed by this record.  |
| Full Graph-source promotion not approved     | Boundary condition; broader promotion requires separate readiness and approval. |

## Execution Outcome

```text
scoped-pilot-executed-with-fallback-ready
```

The pilot is executed only as a bounded Todo Search scoped source-authority pilot record. Generated Evidence and
`comparison-pass` parity are sufficient for this scoped pilot. Tree-native selected-slice artifacts remain retained as
fallback/reference, and broader promotion remains unapproved.

## Review Status

The subsequent review is recorded in
[scoped-source-authority-pilot-review.md](scoped-source-authority-pilot-review.md).

Review outcome:

```text
scoped-pilot-review-pass-with-retained-warnings
```

The review confirms that generated interpretation remains bounded to the Todo Search selected slice, generated/manual
parity remains `comparison-pass`, fallback/reference artifacts remain usable, retained warnings remain visible, and user
acceptance authority remains user-controlled. The review does not expand the pilot or approve broader promotion.

Active observation criteria are recorded in
[scoped-source-authority-pilot-active-observation.md](scoped-source-authority-pilot-active-observation.md). The active
status is `keep-active-with-retained-warnings`; it does not expand pilot scope or approve broader promotion.

| Validator/CI-backed repeatability  | Evidence Control Node        | resolved for scoped pilot / enforcement future | Local validator-backed and reviewed non-enforcing CI-backed Evidence exist for Todo Search; enforcement and broader scope remain future decisions. |

## User Acceptance Boundary

The renewed Todo Search demo-support Acceptance remains user-controlled. This pilot record does not let Codex/PBE
accept product results, source authority changes, broader promotion, or warning retirement on the user's behalf.

## Final Non-Promotion Statement

This record executes a bounded scoped source-authority pilot for `examples/internal-legacy/adoption/todo-search-slice` only.

It does not promote the Maintainability Graph as the repository-wide source model, does not change full PBE source
authority, does not retire tree-native artifacts, does not clean up public docs, does not introduce validator/CI
enforcement, and does not authorize full Graph-source promotion.

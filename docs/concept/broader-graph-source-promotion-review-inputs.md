# Broader Graph-Source Promotion Review Inputs

Status: promotion-review-inputs-ready-with-caveats / review-input-package / docs-only / no-promotion /
no-source-authority-change

## Purpose

This document packages the current graph/read-model Evidence stack as inputs for a future broader Graph-source promotion
review.

It does not approve Graph-source promotion. It does not expand source authority, retire tree-native artifacts, modify
workflow behavior, add enforcement, or replace user acceptance. It only identifies what Evidence is now reviewable and
what caveats still block any actual full promotion decision.

## Current Evidence Inventory

| Evidence area                            | Current reviewable inputs                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Current status                                                                                         |

| Generated Todo Search read-model         | `examples/adoption/todo-search-slice/generated/generated-read-model.json`, `generated-read-model.md`, `read-model-evidence-manifest.json`                                                                                                         | Generated read-model Evidence exists for the bounded Todo Search slice.                                |
| Todo Search parity Evidence              | `examples/adoption/todo-search-slice/generated/read-model-parity-report.json`, `read-model-parity-report.md`, manual read-model artifact                                                                                                          | `comparison-pass`; mismatch/blocking/decision-required counts remain 0/0/0 for the current baseline.   |
| Todo Search validator-backed Evidence    | `examples/adoption/todo-search-slice/generated/read-model-validation-report.json`, `read-model-validation-report.md`                                                                                                                              | `validation-pass`; 40 nodes / 59 edges / 20 checks.                                                    |
| Todo App PBE Run structure-only Evidence | `examples/valid/todo-app-pbe-run/generated/generated-read-model.json`, `read-model-validation-report.json`, `read-model-evidence-manifest.json`                                                                                                   | `validation-pass`; 22 nodes / 38 edges / 16 checks; still `structure-only`.                            |
| Aggregate validate-all summary           | `examples/read-model-aggregate/generated/read-model-aggregate-summary.json`, `read-model-aggregate-summary.md`                                                                                                                                    | `aggregate-pass`; positive registry includes Todo Search and Todo App PBE Run only.                    |

| PR path-filter and failure policy        | `pr-informational-observation-policy.md`, `pr-informational-observation-log.md`, `pr-informational-path-filter-refinement.md`                                                                                                                     | Run-count threshold satisfied; recommendation is no workflow change for now.                           |
| Negative validation robustness           | `examples/invalid/read-model-invalid-view-scoped-tags`, `examples/invalid/read-model-core-view-missing`, `examples/invalid/read-model-pilot-marker-missing`; inline/temp structure-only policy conflict test coverage                             | Local focused test coverage only; not included in positive registry, validate-all aggregate, or CI.    |
| Invalid fixture CI policy                | `read-model-invalid-fixture-ci-policy.md`                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Recommends local-only invalid fixtures for now.                                                        |

| Compatibility/public-doc caveats         | `legacy-compatibility-map.md`, `source-transition-path.md`, `open-questions.md`, public-doc cleanup warnings                                                                                                                                      | Cleanup or explicit waiver remains a caveat before broader promotion.                                  |

## Readiness Summary By Category

| Category                                      | Readiness input state                                                                                                                                    | Review interpretation                                                                                            |
| --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1. Todo Search bounded pilot readiness        | Strong for the selected slice: scoped pilot executed, generated, parity-backed, validator-backed, and CI-backed.                                         | Ready as bounded pilot Evidence, not as repository-wide source authority.                                        |
| 2. Multi-slice positive validation readiness  | Local `validate --all` and CI workflow cover Todo Search plus Todo App PBE Run through the positive registry and aggregate summary.                      | Useful broader-readiness input, but Todo App remains `structure-only`.                                           |
| 3. CI-backed repeatability readiness          | Manual and PR informational workflows are reviewed after registry-backed validate-all switch.                                                            | Repeatability Evidence is mature enough for review input, not for enforcement by itself.                         |
| 4. PR informational observation readiness     | Three PR informational runs reviewed successfully; path-filter/failure-semantics refinement recommends no change for now.                                | Initial observation threshold satisfied; continued observation remains safe.                                     |
| 5. Negative validation robustness readiness   | Durable local invalid fixtures and inline/temp policy conflict coverage exist.                                                                           | Good local robustness signal; not CI-backed under current policy.                                                |
| 6. Rollback/fallback readiness                | Rollback and compatibility concepts are documented; scoped pilot retains tree-native fallback.                                                           | Reviewable concept policy exists, but broader rollback/fallback decision and implementation plan remain pending. |
| 7. Public-doc cleanup / compatibility wording | Compatibility risks are known and retained as warnings.                                                                                                  | Not ready for full promotion unless cleaned up or explicitly waived.                                             |
| 8. Source-authority expansion readiness       | Evidence inputs are stronger than earlier phases, but source expansion plan, user approval, and compatibility-retirement decisions are not yet complete. | Inputs are ready with caveats; broader Graph-source promotion is not approved or ready for execution.            |

Recommended status:

```text
promotion-review-inputs-ready-with-caveats
```

This means the current Evidence stack is coherent enough to support a future broader promotion review package. It does
not mean `promotion-ready`, `promotion-approved`, `graph-source-promoted`, or `source-authority-expanded`.

## Remaining Blockers And Caveats Before Actual Full Promotion

The following remain unresolved before any full Graph-source promotion decision:

| Caveat / blocker                          | Why it matters                                                                                                    |
| ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Public-doc cleanup or explicit waiver     | Legacy wording can still imply task-card or compatibility-view authority unless cleaned up or consciously waived. |
| Source authority expansion plan           | A broader plan must define exactly which artifacts become source, projection, compatibility view, or retired.     |
| Rollback/fallback decision                | Broader authority change needs concrete fallback and recovery behavior, not only scoped-pilot fallback.           |
| Enforcement / required-check policy       | CI Evidence is non-enforcing. Required checks and branch protection need separate user approval if desired.       |
| Todo App PBE Run remains `structure-only` | It is a second positive structural fixture, not parity-backed, pilot-marker-backed, or source-authority-bearing.  |
| Invalid fixtures remain local-only        | Negative robustness is locally tested but not CI-backed under current policy.                                     |
| Compatibility term retirement             | Which compatibility terms and artifacts survive post-promotion remains a separate decision.                       |
| Repo-wide transition/migration plan       | No repository-wide source transition or migration implementation exists.                                          |
| User approval                             | Only the user can approve source authority change, artifact retirement, enforcement, or full promotion.           |

## Explicit Next Decision Surfaces

Possible next steps are separate choices:

| Decision surface                    | Meaning                                                                                                                                   |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Continue observation                | Keep the scoped pilot, manual CI, PR informational workflow, local negative fixtures, and current path filters unchanged.                 |
| Public-doc cleanup preparation      | Prepare cleanup or waiver package for legacy/task-card/source-authority wording before broader promotion.                                 |
| Source authority expansion design   | Define exact authority matrix, artifact roles, source/projection boundaries, and migration/fallback policy for a broader scope.           |
| Enforcement / required-check design | Decide whether CI-backed read-model Evidence should ever become required, and under what warning/waiver semantics.                        |
| Broader promotion decision package  | Assemble Approval Brief or equivalent user judgment surface for a future explicit promotion decision.                                     |
| Defer or rollback scoped pilot      | If retained warnings become unacceptable, decide whether to keep observing, defer, or roll back the bounded Todo Search pilot.            |
| Invalid-fixture CI mode             | Separately decide whether expected-blocking invalid fixture checks should run in manual or PR CI without polluting positive aggregate CI. |

## Non-Scope

This package does not:

- approve actual Graph-source promotion
- expand source authority
- retire tree-native artifacts
- change workflow, code, CLI, tests, or generated artifacts
- create a PR or dispatch GitHub Actions
- add required checks, branch protection, or CI enforcement
- implement public-doc cleanup
- add invalid fixtures to CI or the positive registry
- promote Todo App PBE Run beyond `structure-only`
- replace user acceptance authority

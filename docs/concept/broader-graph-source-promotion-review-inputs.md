# Broader Graph-Source Promotion Review Inputs

Status: promotion-review-inputs-ready-with-caveats / review-input-package / docs-only / no-promotion /
no-source-authority-change

## Purpose

This document packages the current graph/read-model Evidence stack as inputs for a future broader Graph-source promotion
review.

It does not approve Graph-source promotion. It does not expand source authority, retire tree-native artifacts, modify
workflow behavior, add enforcement, or replace user acceptance. It only identifies what Evidence is now reviewable and
what caveats still block any actual full promotion decision.

## Current Evidence Inventory

| Evidence area                            | Current reviewable inputs                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Current status                                                                                                                                        |

## Readiness Summary By Category

| Category                                      | Readiness input state                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Review interpretation                                                                                                         |
| --------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1. Todo Search bounded pilot readiness        | Strong for the selected slice: scoped pilot executed, generated, parity-backed, validator-backed, and CI-backed.                                                                                                                               | Ready as bounded pilot Evidence, not as repository-wide source authority.                                                     |
| 2. Multi-slice positive validation readiness  | Local `validate --all` and CI workflow cover Todo Search plus Todo App PBE Run through the positive registry and aggregate summary.                                                                                                            | Useful broader-readiness input, but Todo App remains `structure-only`.                                                        |
| 3. CI-backed repeatability readiness          | Manual and PR informational workflows are reviewed after registry-backed validate-all switch.                                                                                                                                                  | Repeatability Evidence is mature enough for review input, not for enforcement by itself.                                      |
| 4. PR informational observation readiness     | Three PR informational runs reviewed successfully; path-filter/failure-semantics refinement recommends no change for now.                                                                                                                      | Initial observation threshold satisfied; continued observation remains safe.                                                  |
| 5. Negative validation robustness readiness   | Durable local invalid fixtures and inline/temp policy conflict coverage exist.                                                                                                                                                                 | Good local robustness signal; not CI-backed under current policy.                                                             |
| 6. Rollback/fallback readiness                | Rollback and compatibility concepts are documented; scoped pilot retains tree-native fallback.                                                                                                                                                 | Reviewable concept policy exists, but broader rollback/fallback decision and implementation plan remain pending.              |
| 7. Public-doc cleanup / compatibility wording | Batch A corrected the strongest source-of-truth matrix authority ambiguity; Batch B reframed task-card shorthand docs; Batch C reframed examples, usage, traceability, and audit wording; Batch D reviewed file-format and agent instructions. | Cleanup preparation is around the 90% review threshold, but waiver, promotion, and source-authority approval remain separate. |
| 8. Source-authority expansion readiness       | Evidence inputs are stronger than earlier phases, and a docs-only candidate authority matrix now exists. User approval, concrete rollback/fallback, and compatibility-retirement decisions are not complete.                                   | Inputs are ready with caveats; broader Graph-source promotion is not approved or ready for execution.                         |

Recommended status:

```text
promotion-review-inputs-ready-with-caveats
```

This means the current Evidence stack is coherent enough to support a future broader promotion review package. It does
not mean `promotion-ready`, `promotion-approved`, `graph-source-promoted`, or `source-authority-expanded`.

## Remaining Blockers And Caveats Before Actual Full Promotion

The following remain unresolved before any full Graph-source promotion decision:

| Caveat / blocker                          | Why it matters                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Public-doc cleanup or explicit waiver     | Batch A/B/C cleanup removed the strongest source-of-truth matrix, task-card shorthand, examples, usage, traceability, and audit wording ambiguities; Batch D is reviewed and implemented only where needed; waiver approval remains undone. |
| Source authority expansion plan           | The candidate authority matrix is now documented, but it is not approved or executable; exact approval scope, rollback/fallback mechanics, and retirement rules remain open.                                                                |
| Rollback/fallback decision                | Broader authority change needs concrete fallback and recovery behavior, not only scoped-pilot fallback.                                                                                                                                     |
| Enforcement / required-check policy       | CI Evidence is non-enforcing. Required checks and branch protection need separate user approval if desired.                                                                                                                                 |
| Todo App PBE Run remains `structure-only` | It is a second positive structural fixture, not parity-backed, pilot-marker-backed, or source-authority-bearing.                                                                                                                            |
| Invalid fixtures remain local-only        | Negative robustness is locally tested but not CI-backed under current policy.                                                                                                                                                               |
| Compatibility term retirement             | Which compatibility terms and artifacts survive post-promotion remains a separate decision.                                                                                                                                                 |
| Repo-wide transition/migration plan       | No repository-wide source transition or migration implementation exists.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| User approval                             | Only the user can approve source authority change, artifact retirement, enforcement, or full promotion.                                                                                                                                     |

## Explicit Next Decision Surfaces

Possible next steps are separate choices:

| Decision surface                    | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Continue observation                | Keep the scoped pilot, manual CI, PR informational workflow, local negative fixtures, and current path filters unchanged.                                                  |
| Public-doc cleanup preparation      | Review Batch A/B/C/D cleanup results and decide whether public-doc cleanup is sufficient for a broader promotion decision or whether an explicit waiver is still required. |
| Source authority expansion design   | Review the candidate authority matrix and decide whether to prepare concrete rollback/fallback mechanics or revise the boundary before any promotion package.              |
| Enforcement / required-check design | Decide whether CI-backed read-model Evidence should ever become required, and under what warning/waiver semantics.                                                         |
| Broader promotion decision package  | Assemble Approval Brief or equivalent user judgment surface for a future explicit promotion decision.                                                                      |
| Defer or rollback scoped pilot      | If retained warnings become unacceptable, decide whether to keep observing, defer, or roll back the bounded Todo Search pilot.                                             |
| Invalid-fixture CI mode             | Separately decide whether expected-blocking invalid fixture checks should run in manual or PR CI without polluting positive aggregate CI.                                  |

## Non-Scope

This package does not:

- change workflow, code, CLI, tests, or generated artifacts
- create a PR or dispatch GitHub Actions
- add required checks, branch protection, or CI enforcement
- approve public-doc cleanup as a waiver, source authority change, or promotion decision

# PBE Concept Repository

This directory is the concept repository for PBE runtime architecture alignment. It records the current conceptual
baseline before implementation details, CLI behavior, validators, or migration scripts are expanded.

The work instruction names these files as `concept/...`; in this plugin repository, that concept repository lives at
`docs/concept/...` so it remains inside the public documentation tree.

## Authority Rule

The Product Tree remains the source of product truth for projects managed by PBE. For this plugin's own concept
documentation, the source of truth order is:

1. Confirmed decisions in [decision-log.md](decision-log.md).
2. Canonical and compatibility vocabulary in [glossary.md](glossary.md).
3. Canonical candidate architecture docs in this directory.
4. Existing public docs under `docs/` when they do not conflict with the concept repository.
5. Open questions and active assumptions when no confirmed decision exists.

If a later document conflicts with a confirmed decision, record the conflict instead of silently changing scope.

## Phase 1 Repository Files

| File                                           | Role                                                                              |
| ---------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [decision-log.md](decision-log.md)             | Source of truth for confirmed architecture decisions and supersede relationships. |
| [glossary.md](glossary.md)                     | Canonical, legacy, compatibility, deprecated, and superseded term classification. |
| [open-questions.md](open-questions.md)         | Active unresolved questions only.                                                 |
| [resolved-questions.md](resolved-questions.md) | Questions that were previously open but are now answered by decisions or docs.    |
| [active-assumptions.md](active-assumptions.md) | Current low-risk assumptions that are not yet decisions.                          |
| [assumption-history.md](assumption-history.md) | Resolved, rejected, superseded, or decision-converted assumptions.                |
| [superseded-items.md](superseded-items.md)     | Old frames, terms, or structures replaced by current decisions.                   |

Resolved questions and assumptions converted into decisions must not remain active.

## Phase 2 Core Architecture Docs

The current canonical candidate docs are:

- [pbe-runtime-architecture.md](pbe-runtime-architecture.md)
- [maintainability-graph.md](maintainability-graph.md)
- [view-tree-pack.md](view-tree-pack.md)
- [change-lifecycle.md](change-lifecycle.md)
- [execution-contract.md](execution-contract.md)

These documents define concept structure only. They do not define TypeScript models, CLI commands, validators, migration
scripts, or implementation tasks.

## Outline-Only Later-Phase Docs

The following files intentionally stay as outlines in this phase:

- [approval-brief.md](approval-brief.md)
- [check-evidence-policy.md](check-evidence-policy.md)
- [control-node-policy.md](control-node-policy.md)
- [legacy-compatibility-map.md](legacy-compatibility-map.md)

Feasibility demonstration, detailed policy design, type models, CLI command design, validators, and migration scripts are
next-phase candidates only.

## Outline Gate Common Criteria

Gate 4 through Gate 6 are outline gates for this Phase 1-2 pass. Passing an outline gate does not mean detailed design is
complete. It means the outline clearly states:

1. The topic purpose.
2. The currently confirmed decisions.
3. That this phase does not detail-design the topic.
4. The items to write in the next phase.
5. The remaining open questions.

Outline gates do not require detailed policies, implementation structure, CLI behavior, or data models.

## Scope Limit

This work stabilizes what PBE is before implementation details are expanded. A good result is a small set of clear
canonical candidate documents and well-separated open questions, not a large amount of premature detail.

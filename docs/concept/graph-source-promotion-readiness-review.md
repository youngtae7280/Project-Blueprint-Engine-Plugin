# Graph-source Promotion Readiness Review

Status: readiness review report

## Document Purpose

This document reviews whether PBE is ready to ask for a future Graph-source promotion decision.

It classifies retained warnings, checks promotion prerequisites, and identifies blockers or remaining decisions after
the representative runtime feasibility demo was accepted with warnings.

This document is not:

- a Graph-source promotion decision
- a source authority change
- a migration plan
- a generated graph builder design
- a CLI, schema, runtime, or validator implementation
- public-doc cleanup
- full Todo app implementation

Current operational source is now scoped. Maintainability Graph is the limited source model for the Todo Search
selected-slice authority surface, while tree-native artifacts remain operational source outside explicitly promoted
scopes.

AI self-report is not Evidence for this review. Readiness findings are based on reviewable files, linked records,
passing fixture command Evidence, and explicit exception or warning records.

## Executive Recommendation

Historical recommendation before the Graph-first Node/Edge/Tag refresh: the limited pilot decision surface was
reviewable with warnings.

Current recommendation after the Graph-first Node/Edge/Tag refresh:

```text
ready for renewed limited pilot user decision with warnings
```

Current decision outcome after the user response:

```text
Approve limited pilot promotion decision
```

This outcome is bounded to `examples/internal-legacy/adoption/todo-search-slice` and is recorded in
[limited-pilot-transition-record.md](limited-pilot-transition-record.md). It is not full Graph-source promotion and does
not change source authority.

Subsequent execution-mode outcome:

```text
Run dry-run / review-only scoped pilot first
```

The dry-run observation result is recorded as `usable-with-warnings` in
[dry-run-scoped-limited-pilot-observation-record.md](dry-run-scoped-limited-pilot-observation-record.md). It is
review-only and does not approve scoped source-authority pilot execution.

The user later approved actual scoped source-authority pilot execution for the Todo Search selected slice only after
generated Evidence and `comparison-pass` parity were recorded. That execution is documented in
[scoped-source-authority-pilot-execution-record.md](scoped-source-authority-pilot-execution-record.md). This readiness
review still does not approve full Graph-source promotion or repository-wide source authority change.

The subsequent scoped pilot review is documented in
[scoped-source-authority-pilot-review.md](scoped-source-authority-pilot-review.md). It passes with retained warnings and
keeps the pilot safe to observe in the bounded Todo Search scope, but it still does not authorize broader promotion,
validator/CI enforcement, public-doc cleanup, or tree-native artifact retirement.

Active observation criteria are documented in
[scoped-source-authority-pilot-active-observation.md](scoped-source-authority-pilot-active-observation.md). This keeps the
pilot active with retained warnings and leaves full-promotion readiness as a separate future review.

[validator-ci-backed-read-model-evidence-design.md](validator-ci-backed-read-model-evidence-design.md) now defines how
validator-backed and CI-backed read-model Evidence could support broader execution/enforcement or full-promotion review
later. The scoped Todo Search validator-backed Evidence command is now implemented and produces `validation-pass` for
the current bounded pilot artifacts. Reviewed manual CI-backed Evidence exists for Todo Search run `28151296796`,
aggregate-enabled run `28156403793`, and post-update Node 24 run `28157938343`, while CI enforcement remains
unimplemented and does not follow from this review automatically.

[ci-backed-read-model-evidence-workflow-design.md](ci-backed-read-model-evidence-workflow-design.md) now defines the
CI workflow integration surface for read-model Evidence. The first implementation is a non-enforcing manual
`workflow_dispatch` workflow. It does not make CI required, add PR/push triggers, or change source authority. Run
`28151296796` provides reviewed CI-backed Evidence for the Todo Search selected slice, run `28156403793` provides
reviewed aggregate-enabled CI-backed Evidence for the declared bundle, and run `28157938343` confirms the same bundle
after the Node 24 action/runtime update.

[broader-graph-source-promotion-review-inputs.md](broader-graph-source-promotion-review-inputs.md) now packages the
matured scoped pilot, generated/parity/validation reports, registry-backed `validate --all`, manual and PR CI-backed
Evidence, local negative fixture coverage, and path-filter/failure-semantics policy as future promotion-review inputs.
Its status is `promotion-review-inputs-ready-with-caveats`, not `promotion-ready` or `promotion-approved`.

[source-authority-expansion-design-package.md](source-authority-expansion-design-package.md) now defines a docs-only
candidate broader authority matrix, artifact roles, staged expansion path, and risks. It helps prepare a future
promotion decision package, but it does not expand source authority, approve promotion, retire tree-native artifacts, or
change user acceptance boundaries.

[source-authority-rollback-fallback-plan.md](source-authority-rollback-fallback-plan.md) now defines fallback precedence,
rollback triggers, trigger-specific actions, snapshot/reference requirements, and compatibility-retirement guardrails for
that candidate matrix. It does not execute rollback, change source authority, or approve promotion.

[broader-graph-source-promotion-decision-package.md](broader-graph-source-promotion-decision-package.md) packaged the
matured Evidence inventory, public-doc cleanup status, candidate authority matrix, and rollback/fallback plan into the
user-facing decision surface for broader Graph-source promotion. Its readiness label is
`promotion-decision-package-ready / preparation-complete-with-user-decision-required`. This is a preparation-complete
state for user judgment only; no source authority expansion, Graph-source promotion, enforcement, tree-native
retirement, or user acceptance change is executed.

[broader-graph-source-promotion-execution-record.md](broader-graph-source-promotion-execution-record.md) now records the
user-approved limited execution branch. Maintainability Graph is the source model for the Todo Search selected-slice
authority surface; tree-native selected-slice artifacts are maintained as compatibility / fallback / reference; repo-wide
promotion, tree-native retirement, CI enforcement, invalid-fixture CI, and Todo App promotion remain out of scope.

[public-doc-cleanup-waiver-decision-package.md](public-doc-cleanup-waiver-decision-package.md) now records the public
documentation cleanup or explicit waiver decision package for one of those caveats. It inventories public/user-facing
docs and recommends cleanup before actual full promotion unless the user explicitly approves a visible waiver.
[public-doc-cleanup-implementation-plan.md](public-doc-cleanup-implementation-plan.md) breaks that cleanup into staged
batches. Batch A, Batch B, and Batch C are now implemented as review candidates, and Batch D is reviewed and implemented
only where needed. No waiver is approved.

Preparation outcome:

```text
Proceed to scoped source-authority pilot preparation
```

The preparation package is recorded in
[scoped-source-authority-pilot-preparation-package.md](scoped-source-authority-pilot-preparation-package.md). It
recommends generated builder / CLI-backed read-model output before actual authority-bearing execution and does not
approve execution.

Generated read-model prerequisite outcome:

```text
Require generated builder / CLI-backed read-model before execution
```

The requirement is recorded in
[generated-read-model-evidence-requirement.md](generated-read-model-evidence-requirement.md). It is not implementation
approval and does not create generated output.

CLI-backed output design outcome:

```text
Prepare CLI-backed evidence output design first
```

The design is recorded in
[cli-backed-read-model-evidence-output-design.md](cli-backed-read-model-evidence-output-design.md). It defines future
command/surface candidates, generated output artifacts, comparison reports, mismatch categories, and status labels. It
does not implement CLI, builder, parser, validator/CI, or generated output.

Meaning:

- The representative lifecycle slice is demonstrated with retained warnings.
- The policy chain through Rollback / Compatibility Strategy is reviewable.
- A manual Node/Edge/Tag read-model parity artifact now makes the graph/read-model relationship reviewable for limited
  pilot decision preparation.
- The View Instance Manifest shows 7 Core View coverage, including Scope / Execution View.
- Limited pilot option approval is now granted for the bounded Todo Search transition record only.
- Full promotion still needs explicit user judgment about generated builder/repeatability, public-doc cleanup, and
  full-product/runtime parity.
- Graph-source promotion must not be approved or declared from this review alone.

Former blocking item in the earlier review cycle:

```text
Generated Maintainability Graph / read-model output is missing.
```

Updated status:

```text
resolved for limited pilot review by manual Node/Edge/Tag parity artifact
```

Evidence:

- `examples/internal-legacy/adoption/todo-search-slice/maintainability-graph-read-model.json`
- `examples/internal-legacy/adoption/todo-search-slice/maintainability-graph-read-model.md`
- `examples/internal-legacy/adoption/todo-search-slice/parity-check.md`
- `examples/internal-legacy/adoption/todo-search-slice/view-instance-manifest.json`
- `examples/internal-legacy/adoption/todo-search-slice/view-instance-manifest.md`

These artifacts show durable node kinds, durable edge types, view-scoped tags, confidence/freshness separation, 7 Core
View coverage, retained warnings, and source-authority boundaries. They do not implement a generated graph builder and
do not justify full promotion by themselves.

| Bounded fixture Evidence, not full Todo app implementation | acceptable warning               | The bounded fixture is acceptable for representative lifecycle feasibility and limited pilot readiness discussion. It is not proof of full product runtime parity.                                                              | Carry as a pilot/full distinction.

| UI screenshot/manual visual evidence partial               | acceptable warning               | The representative source-model promotion question is not blocked by missing UI screenshot Evidence because behavior Evidence and warning state are visible. It remains a product/UI evidence gap.                              | Keep visible as a retained warning.

## Promotion Recommendation

This review no longer treats the limited Todo Search branch as merely pending. That branch is executed separately.

It recommends for any scope beyond that branch:

```text
continue post-promotion observation; require separate approval for repo-wide promotion
```

Prepared decision surface:

- [limited-pilot-promotion-decision-package.md](limited-pilot-promotion-decision-package.md)

The package state is now `User approved limited pilot option after Graph-first baseline refresh`. The bounded transition
record is [limited-pilot-transition-record.md](limited-pilot-transition-record.md). Full promotion and broad source
authority change remain not approved.

Allowed next actions:

- use the bounded transition record for scoped pilot transition planning
- ask the user whether generated builder/repeatable graph output is required before full promotion
- ask the user whether Batch A/B/C/D public-doc cleanup is sufficient for promotion review or whether an explicit waiver is still needed

Not allowed from this review:

- declaring Maintainability Graph the repository-wide current operational source
- marking tree-native artifacts superseded
- treating the manual parity artifact as a generated builder or full-promotion proof
- treating demo-slice renewed Acceptance as source promotion approval

## Readiness Review Approval Brief

### Intent Understood

PBE is asking whether the Graph-source promotion process is ready for a user promotion decision, based on the
representative demo result and retained warning review.

### Result Summary

The representative demo slice is demonstrated with retained warnings. The compatibility mismatch path is supported by
real repository wording. PP-001 is confirmed, runtime fixture Evidence is present/fresh, and renewed demo-slice
Acceptance is user-approved with warnings retained.

### Remaining Judgment

The user approved the bounded limited pilot option, dry-run, bounded scoped execution, active observation, local
validator-backed Evidence, non-enforcing CI-backed Evidence, and PR informational observation. Remaining judgment
concerns whether to:

1. keep observing PR informational runs under [pr-informational-observation-policy.md](pr-informational-observation-policy.md),
   refine filters later, design enforcement policy, or prepare multi-slice validation,
2. review Batch A/B/C/D and decide whether cleanup is sufficient, whether a waiver is required, or whether more public-doc cleanup is needed before full promotion,
3. require full-product/runtime/UI Evidence before full promotion or only before full product parity claims, and
4. use [broader-graph-source-promotion-review-inputs.md](broader-graph-source-promotion-review-inputs.md) to choose
   the next review branch, review the candidate authority matrix in
   [source-authority-expansion-design-package.md](source-authority-expansion-design-package.md), use
   [broader-graph-source-promotion-decision-package.md](broader-graph-source-promotion-decision-package.md) for the
   explicit user choice, or keep observing the scoped pilot.

### Approval Choice Candidates

- `Keep scoped pilot active and observe with validator-backed and CI-backed Evidence`
- `Keep PR informational mode non-enforcing and observe under policy`
- `Refine PR informational path filters after enough observation`
- `Design CI enforcement / required check policy`
- `Require public-doc cleanup before promotion decision`
- `Use broader Graph-source promotion review inputs to choose the next decision surface`
- `Rollback / defer scoped pilot`
- `Stop promotion readiness and continue concept/implementation hardening`

### State Label

```text
Decision required
```

Reason: the Graph-first Node/Edge/Tag baseline refresh, bounded scoped execution, active observation, local
validator-backed Evidence, Batch A/B/C/D public-doc cleanup review, source-authority expansion design, rollback/fallback
plan, and broader promotion decision package are recorded. Full promotion, broad source authority change, CI
enforcement, waiver judgment, and any actual execution still require explicit user approval.

## Remaining Blockers / Decisions

### Limited Pilot Promotion Decision State

- No blocker remains for the bounded limited pilot transition record.
- Limited pilot option approval is recorded for the Todo Search selected slice only.
- Full promotion approval, CI enforcement, remaining public-doc cleanup, and scope expansion remain separate and must not be
  inferred from this review.

### Full Promotion / Repeatability Question

- Generated graph builder, CLI-backed parity, and local validator-backed Evidence now exist for the Todo Search scoped
  pilot.
- Todo Search read-model assumptions are now isolated into an explicit profile/config without intended behavior change.
- `examples/valid/todo-app-devview-run` now has structure-only generated/validation Evidence as a second profile/fixture.
- Todo Search and Todo App DevView Run validation reports now carry per-slice independence metadata for future aggregation
  inputs.
- The first multi-slice aggregate summary exists as Evidence-only output over existing per-slice validation reports.
  The manual workflow now includes the aggregate summarize command, and runs `28156403793` / `28157938343` reviewed the
  aggregate-enabled artifact bundle as non-enforcing CI-backed Evidence. PR informational trigger behavior is
  implemented and PR run `28207822252` reviewed it as a non-enforcing `pull_request-informational` Evidence signal.
  [read-model-validate-all-contract.md](read-model-validate-all-contract.md) now records the design-only all-slice
  validation contract. `validate --all` implementation, CI enforcement, and full-promotion waiver policy remain future
  questions.

### Decisions Needed Before Promotion Approval

- Whether full promotion requires CI-backed graph/read-model Evidence or an explicit user waiver.
- Whether the candidate authority matrix and rollback/fallback plan are sufficient for a promotion decision package.
- Whether bounded fixture Evidence is enough for the pilot decision surface.
- Whether Batch A/B/C/D public-doc cleanup is sufficient for promotion approval or still needs an explicit compatibility
  waiver.
- Whether full-product/runtime/UI Evidence is required before promotion approval or only before full product parity
  claims.

## Final Scoped-Promotion Statement

This readiness review records that a separate execution record approves and executes limited Graph-source promotion.

This readiness review does not approve repo-wide promotion or additional source authority expansion.

This readiness review does not make Maintainability Graph the repository-wide current operational source.

This readiness review does not retire tree-native artifacts.

Tree-native artifacts remain operational source outside promoted scopes and remain fallback/reference inside the
promoted Todo Search selected-slice scope.

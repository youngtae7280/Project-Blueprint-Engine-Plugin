# Graph Source Artifact Storage And Projection Generation Design

Status: first-artifact-implemented / minimal-cli-projection-path / graph-source-backed-generation /
structure-only-candidate-projection / candidate-observation-ci-artifact-capture /
todo-app-non-authority-validate-all-enrollment-local-first

## Purpose

This document defines the next implementation branch after limited Graph-source promotion:

```text
Graph source artifact/storage + projection generation
```

It prepares and now records the first storage and projection step for the promoted Todo Search selected-slice scope. The
first non-generated graph source artifact exists, and focused tests prove projection preserves the current Todo Search
read-model shape. A minimal CLI projection path now writes an explicit generated projection artifact when invoked. This
now also backs Todo Search default read-model generation from the bounded graph source records. It does not change
workflows, retained fallback artifacts, Todo App structure-only behavior, or source authority beyond the executed limited
scope.

The next bounded expansion surface is now present as a candidate-only artifact for the Todo App PBE Run:

```text
examples/valid/todo-app-pbe-run/graph-source-candidate.json
```

This candidate mirrors the current structure-only generated read-model records for reviewability. It is now consumed by
local positive `validate --all` only as a non-authority structure-only projection-contract check; it is not uploaded as CI
authority, not parity-backed, not pilot-marker-backed, and not promoted.

## Current Baseline

| Area                  | Current state                                                                                                                                        |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Promoted scope        | Todo Search selected-slice authority surface.                                                                                                        |
| Source model in scope | Maintainability Graph, as recorded by [broader-graph-source-promotion-execution-record.md](broader-graph-source-promotion-execution-record.md).      |
| Fallback/reference    | Tree-native selected-slice artifacts retained as maintained compatibility / fallback / reference artifacts.                                          |
| Graph source artifact | `examples/adoption/todo-search-slice/graph-source.json` exists as non-generated limited source artifact.                                             |
| Generated projections | Existing generated read-model artifacts and the graph-source projection output remain Evidence/projection outputs, not independent source authority. |
| Positive registry     | `examples/read-model-aggregate/read-model-slices.json` includes Todo Search and Todo App PBE Run only.                                               |
| Todo App PBE Run      | `structure-only`, with a non-authority candidate projection contract in local positive validate-all; not source-bearing.                             |
| CI                    | Manual and PR informational, non-enforcing.                                                                                                          |

## Candidate Storage Locations

| Candidate location                                                | Pros                                                                    | Risks / caveats                                                                                  | Recommendation                   |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| `examples/adoption/todo-search-slice/graph-source.json`           | Co-located with promoted scope; clearly non-generated if at slice root. | Needs schema and projection rules before creation.                                               | Preferred first candidate.       |
| `examples/adoption/todo-search-slice/generated/graph-source.json` | Close to generated Evidence.                                            | Bad boundary: source artifact under `generated/` can imply generated output is source authority. | Avoid.                           |
| `examples/read-model-aggregate/graph-source-registry.json`        | Could support future multi-slice source registry.                       | Too broad for first limited promoted scope.                                                      | Defer.                           |
| `.pbe/graph/source.json`                                          | Closer to future canonical repo layout.                                 | Repo has no active `.pbe/` artifacts here; premature for example-scope branch.                   | Future-only.                     |
| Docs-only concept record                                          | Lowest risk.                                                            | Cannot support projection generation.                                                            | Already covered by current docs. |

## Recommended First Artifact Shape

The first graph source artifact is strict JSON, non-generated, and located outside `generated/`:

```text
examples/adoption/todo-search-slice/graph-source.json
```

Implemented shape:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "artifactRole": "limited-graph-source",
  "promotionScope": "todo-search-selected-slice",
  "sourceAuthorityBoundary": "...",
  "fallbackReferences": [],
  "nodes": [],
  "edges": [],
  "viewPolicies": [],
  "projectionTargets": []
}
```

The artifact should store durable graph source records. It should not store generated report status as source facts.

## Projection Generation Expectations

Current projection helper and CLI surface:

```text
loadGraphSourceArtifact -> projectGraphSourceReadModel -> projectGraphSourceReadModelToFile
pbe graph read-model project --graph-source examples/adoption/todo-search-slice/graph-source.json --output examples/adoption/todo-search-slice/generated/graph-source-read-model-projection.json
```

Focused tests prove that projection from `graph-source.json` preserves the current Todo Search generated read-model
nodes, edges, and Core View coverage. Contract tests now also validate the committed source/projection artifact pair for
metadata, source scope, projection role, fallback/reference retention, user-acceptance boundary, non-promotion wording,
expected counts, Core Views, and source-record parity. Local registry-backed `validate --all` now runs this projection
contract check for the Todo Search profile and exposes `projectionContractStatus` in JSON output. The generated
projection artifact is:

```text
examples/adoption/todo-search-slice/generated/graph-source-read-model-projection.json
```

Todo Search `graph read-model generate --slice examples/adoption/todo-search-slice` now uses the same bounded graph
source records for generated nodes, edges, and Core View coverage while preserving the existing generated Evidence role,
manual parity pass, validation pass, and 40-node / 59-edge / 7-Core-View shape.
Manual CI run `28219396764` and PR #5 run `28219583619` reviewed this graph-source-backed generation path with
`ci-evidence-pass`, `comparison-pass`, `validation-pass`, and `projection-contract-pass`.

Future projection generation hardening should:

1. Read the promoted graph source artifact.
2. Generate or refresh read-model / view projection artifacts into `generated/`.
3. Compare generated projections against retained fallback/reference artifacts where parity is required.
4. Preserve source, projection, Evidence, fallback, and user-acceptance boundaries in every output manifest.
5. Keep Todo App PBE Run structure-only unless a separate authority package promotes it.

## Todo App Candidate Artifact

The Todo App candidate artifact is strict JSON, non-generated, and located outside `generated/`:

```text
examples/valid/todo-app-pbe-run/graph-source-candidate.json
```

Implemented boundary:

- `artifactRole: candidate-graph-source`
- `status: candidate-not-promoted`
- `candidateScope: todo-app-pbe-run-structure-only`
- `policyLevel: structure-only`
- source records preserve the current 22-node / 38-edge / 7-Core-View structure-only projection
- candidate boundaries state that the artifact may be consumed by positive validate-all only as a non-authority
  structure-only projection contract

Focused tests parse the candidate, compare its records to the existing Todo App structure-only generated read-model, and
reject attempts to mark the candidate as promoted or source-authority-bearing.

The same `graph read-model project --graph-source ... --output ...` CLI surface now projects this candidate into:

```text
examples/valid/todo-app-pbe-run/generated/graph-source-candidate-read-model-projection.json
```

The candidate projection preserves 22 nodes, 38 edges, and 7 Core Views. Its metadata uses
`candidate_graph_source_read_model_projection` and `structure-only`; its boundaries state that it does not promote Todo
App PBE Run, does not add parity or pilot marker requirements, and may participate in positive validate-all only as a
non-authority structure-only projection contract. Focused tests now validate the committed candidate projection contract
directly and reject projection boundary drift, including source-authority creation claims.

The local observation command checks this candidate projection outside positive validate-all semantics:

```bash
pbe graph read-model observe-candidates
```

It reports `candidate-observation-pass` when the Todo App candidate projection contract passes, or
`candidate-observation-blocked` when the candidate projection is missing, malformed, or claims source authority. This
command remains local and non-promotional; positive validate-all enrollment is handled separately as a bounded
non-authority structure-only projection-contract check.

The non-enforcing read-model Evidence workflow now runs the same observation command after positive validate-all and
uploads:

```text
examples/read-model-aggregate/generated/read-model-candidate-observation-output.json
examples/valid/todo-app-pbe-run/generated/graph-source-candidate-read-model-projection.json
```

The CI manifest and Step Summary expose `candidateObservationStatus` and the Todo App candidate projection status as
separate observation metadata. These fields do not change `validateAllStatus`, `aggregateStatus`, the positive registry,
source authority, or Todo App promotion status.

Manual workflow run `28221088498` reviewed this candidate-observation capture on `workflow_dispatch` at commit
`68c2d20775ecbdd118a7d7b91053239ed4cd97f9`. The artifact manifest recorded
`candidateObservationStatus: candidate-observation-pass`, Todo App candidate `candidate-projection-contract-pass`,
positive Todo App projection `not-configured`, `validateAllStatus: aggregate-pass`, and `aggregateStatus:
aggregate-pass`. The artifact bundle included both `read-model-candidate-observation-output.json` and
`graph-source-candidate-read-model-projection.json`.
PR #6 run `28221326457` reviewed the same fields in `pull_request-informational` mode with PR metadata present.

The next decision surface is now recorded in
[todo-app-graph-source-enrollment-decision-package.md](todo-app-graph-source-enrollment-decision-package.md). It
records the local-first bounded non-authority enrollment into positive validate-all. Manual and PR CI review of the new
Todo App positive projection status remains pending.

## Initial Implementation Sequence

Recommended sequence:

1. Review the graph source projection helper, CLI surface, artifact shape, and contract hardening tests.
2. Keep manual/PR workflow observation of projection contract status visible.
3. Add parity/validation tests for any new projection output shape before broadening its use.
4. Keep `validate --all` positive registry behavior bounded to the declared Todo Search and Todo App profiles.

## Non-Scope

This design does not:

- create a repo-wide graph source artifact
- modify workflow trigger mode, required checks, or enforcement
- regenerate unrelated generated artifacts
- add enforcement or required checks
- promote Todo App PBE Run beyond `structure-only`
- promote the Todo App candidate artifact into source authority or beyond `structure-only`
- execute repo-wide Graph-source promotion
- retire tree-native artifacts
- replace user acceptance

# Graph Source Artifact Storage And Projection Generation Design

Status: first-artifact-implemented / minimal-cli-projection-path / graph-source-backed-generation / no-workflow-change

## Purpose

This document defines the next implementation branch after limited Graph-source promotion:

```text
Graph source artifact/storage + projection generation
```

It prepares and now records the first storage and projection step for the promoted Todo Search selected-slice scope. The
first non-generated graph source artifact exists, and focused tests prove projection preserves the current Todo Search
read-model shape. A minimal CLI projection path now writes an explicit generated projection artifact when invoked. This
now also backs Todo Search default read-model generation from the bounded graph source records. It does not change
workflows, retained fallback artifacts, Todo App structure-only behavior, or source authority beyond the executed limited
scope.

## Current Baseline

| Area                  | Current state                                                                                                                                        |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Promoted scope        | Todo Search selected-slice authority surface.                                                                                                        |
| Source model in scope | Maintainability Graph, as recorded by [broader-graph-source-promotion-execution-record.md](broader-graph-source-promotion-execution-record.md).      |
| Fallback/reference    | Tree-native selected-slice artifacts retained as maintained compatibility / fallback / reference artifacts.                                          |
| Graph source artifact | `examples/adoption/todo-search-slice/graph-source.json` exists as non-generated limited source artifact.                                             |
| Generated projections | Existing generated read-model artifacts and the graph-source projection output remain Evidence/projection outputs, not independent source authority. |
| Positive registry     | `examples/read-model-aggregate/read-model-slices.json` includes Todo Search and Todo App PBE Run only.                                               |
| Todo App PBE Run      | `structure-only`, not source-bearing.                                                                                                                |
| CI                    | Manual and PR informational, non-enforcing.                                                                                                          |

## Candidate Storage Locations

| Candidate location                                                | Pros                                                                    | Risks / caveats                                                                                  | Recommendation                   |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| `examples/adoption/todo-search-slice/graph-source.json`           | Co-located with promoted scope; clearly non-generated if at slice root. | Needs schema and projection rules before creation.                                               | Preferred first candidate.       |
| `examples/adoption/todo-search-slice/generated/graph-source.json` | Close to generated Evidence.                                            | Bad boundary: source artifact under `generated/` can imply generated output is source authority. | Avoid.                           |
| `examples/read-model-aggregate/graph-source-registry.json`        | Could support future multi-slice source registry.                       | Too broad for first limited promoted scope.                                                      | Defer.                           |
| `.pbe/graph/source.json`                                          | Closer to future canonical repo layout.                                 | Repo has no active `.pbe/` artifacts here; premature for example-scope branch.                   | Future-only.                     |
| Docs-only concept record                                          | Lowest risk.                                                            | Cannot support projection generation.                                                            | Already covered by current docs. |

## Recommended First Artifact Shape

The first graph source artifact is strict JSON, non-generated, and located outside `generated/`:

```text
examples/adoption/todo-search-slice/graph-source.json
```

Implemented shape:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "artifactRole": "limited-graph-source",
  "promotionScope": "todo-search-selected-slice",
  "sourceAuthorityBoundary": "...",
  "fallbackReferences": [],
  "nodes": [],
  "edges": [],
  "viewPolicies": [],
  "projectionTargets": []
}
```

The artifact should store durable graph source records. It should not store generated report status as source facts.

## Projection Generation Expectations

Current projection helper and CLI surface:

```text
loadGraphSourceArtifact -> projectGraphSourceReadModel -> projectGraphSourceReadModelToFile
pbe graph read-model project --graph-source examples/adoption/todo-search-slice/graph-source.json --output examples/adoption/todo-search-slice/generated/graph-source-read-model-projection.json
```

Focused tests prove that projection from `graph-source.json` preserves the current Todo Search generated read-model
nodes, edges, and Core View coverage. Contract tests now also validate the committed source/projection artifact pair for
metadata, source scope, projection role, fallback/reference retention, user-acceptance boundary, non-promotion wording,
expected counts, Core Views, and source-record parity. Local registry-backed `validate --all` now runs this projection
contract check for the Todo Search profile and exposes `projectionContractStatus` in JSON output. The generated
projection artifact is:

```text
examples/adoption/todo-search-slice/generated/graph-source-read-model-projection.json
```

Todo Search `graph read-model generate --slice examples/adoption/todo-search-slice` now uses the same bounded graph
source records for generated nodes, edges, and Core View coverage while preserving the existing generated Evidence role,
manual parity pass, validation pass, and 40-node / 59-edge / 7-Core-View shape.
Manual CI run `28219396764` and PR #5 run `28219583619` reviewed this graph-source-backed generation path with
`ci-evidence-pass`, `comparison-pass`, `validation-pass`, and `projection-contract-pass`.

Future projection generation hardening should:

1. Read the promoted graph source artifact.
2. Generate or refresh read-model / view projection artifacts into `generated/`.
3. Compare generated projections against retained fallback/reference artifacts where parity is required.
4. Preserve source, projection, Evidence, fallback, and user-acceptance boundaries in every output manifest.
5. Keep Todo App PBE Run structure-only unless a separate authority package promotes it.

## Initial Implementation Sequence

Recommended sequence:

1. Review the graph source projection helper, CLI surface, artifact shape, and contract hardening tests.
2. Keep manual/PR workflow observation of projection contract status visible.
3. Add parity/validation tests for any new projection output shape before broadening its use.
4. Keep `validate --all` positive registry behavior bounded to the declared Todo Search and Todo App profiles.

## Non-Scope

This design does not:

- create a repo-wide graph source artifact
- modify workflow or CI
- regenerate unrelated generated artifacts
- add enforcement or required checks
- promote Todo App PBE Run beyond `structure-only`
- execute repo-wide Graph-source promotion
- retire tree-native artifacts
- replace user acceptance

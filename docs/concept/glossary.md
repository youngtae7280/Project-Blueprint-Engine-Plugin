## Canonical Terms

| Term                    | Status    | Meaning                                                                                                                              |

| Evidence Tree           | canonical | Test results, logs, diffs, screenshots, manual notes, and other proof linked to nodes and criteria.                                  |
| Acceptance Tree         | canonical | User-controlled closure state for product branches or slices.                                                                        |

## Legacy, Deprecated, And Superseded Terms

| Term                                   | Status     | Canonical Reading                                                                                  |

| 5 Layer                                | legacy     | Legacy explanatory frame. It is not the active architecture baseline.                              |
| Knowledge Graph                        | legacy     | Older or generic phrase for the traceability idea now narrowed to Maintainability Graph.           |
| GUI                                    | superseded | PBE does not pursue a GUI product direction unless the user explicitly changes product direction.  |
| SaaS backend                           | superseded | PBE does not pursue a SaaS backend direction unless the user explicitly changes product direction. |
| API provider                           | superseded | PBE does not provide a separate OpenAI API provider.                                               |
| Direct task execution from user prompt | deprecated | Product and work must pass through Product, Project, Work, Test, Cycle, and contract derivation.   |

## Conditional Term Mapping

Some older documents may use canonical terms as projection labels rather than source artifacts. Read them carefully:

| Older Usage                                | Interpretation                                                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Product Tree used as a UI or analysis view | Treat as an Intent / Flow View or compatibility projection unless the file is a tree artifact. |
| Work Tree used as task-card grouping       | Treat as a Work View or View Tree Pack source unless it refers to `.pbe/tree/work-tree.json`.  |
| AI Context Pack used as execution input    | Treat as Execution Contract context shorthand.                                                 |

If a new canonical term seems necessary but does not have a basis in existing docs or the work instruction, record it as
an open question instead of adding it here.

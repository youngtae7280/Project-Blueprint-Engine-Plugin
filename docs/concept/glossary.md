# Concept Glossary

Terms are classified as `canonical`, `legacy`, `compatibility`, `deprecated`, or `superseded`.

| Approval Action      | canonical | The user choice available in the brief: Approve this step, Request revision, Resolve required item, or Defer approval.             |
| Ready for approval   | canonical | State where required checks have sufficient fresh evidence or no check applies, and no required user judgment or blocker remains.  |
| Review with warning  | canonical | State where result may be approvable but a visible low-risk warning, explicit low-risk exception, or non-blocking unknown remains. |
| Decision required    | canonical | State where approval or progress requires a user answer, choice, confirmation, or risk acceptance.                                 |

## Conditional Term Mapping

Some older documents may use canonical terms as projection labels rather than source artifacts. Read them carefully:

| Older Usage                                | Interpretation                                                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Product Tree used as a UI or analysis view | Treat as an Intent / Flow View or compatibility projection unless the file is a tree artifact. |
| Work Tree used as task-card grouping       | Treat as a Work View or View Tree Pack source unless it refers to `.pbe/tree/work-tree.json`.  |
| AI Context Pack used as execution input    | Treat as Execution Contract context shorthand.                                                 |

If a new canonical term seems necessary but does not have a basis in existing docs or the work instruction, record it as
an open question instead of adding it here.

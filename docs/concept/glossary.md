| Term                                       | Status    | Meaning                                                                                                         |
| ------------------------------------------ | --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Feasibility status: demonstrated           | canonical | Required feasibility claim or scenario has observable Evidence and no unresolved blocker.                       |
| Feasibility status: partially demonstrated | canonical | Some Evidence exists, but coverage, freshness, or scenario breadth is limited.                                  |
| Feasibility status: blocked                | canonical | A required feasibility claim or scenario cannot be judged safely with current artifacts.                        |
| Feasibility status: deferred               | canonical | A claim or scenario is intentionally postponed with reason, risk, and later remedy condition.                   |
| Feasibility status: not-applicable         | canonical | A claim or scenario does not apply to the selected representative feasibility slice.                            |
| Representative slice                       | canonical | Bounded lifecycle slice selected to demonstrate runtime feasibility without proving all PBE behavior.           |
| Demo Evidence review checklist             | canonical | Review criteria for whether a future demo result has observable Evidence and linked records.                    |
| Demo output shape                          | canonical | Concept-level reporting shape for a future demo result; not a generated artifact specification.                 |
| Manual Evidence pack                       | canonical | Reviewable evidence result assembled from observable files, commands, linked records, and explicit gap records. |

## Approval Brief Terms

| Term                 | Status    | Meaning                                                                                                                            |
| -------------------- | --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Approval Brief State | canonical | The user-facing approval situation: Ready for approval, Review with warning, Decision required, or Blocked.                        |
| Approval Action      | canonical | The user choice available in the brief: Approve this step, Request revision, Resolve required item, or Defer approval.             |
| Ready for approval   | canonical | State where required checks have sufficient fresh evidence or no check applies, and no required user judgment or blocker remains.  |
| Review with warning  | canonical | State where result may be approvable but a visible low-risk warning, explicit low-risk exception, or non-blocking unknown remains. |
| Decision required    | canonical | State where approval or progress requires a user answer, choice, confirmation, or risk acceptance.                                 |
| Blocked              | canonical | State where PBE cannot safely continue or present the result as approvable until a blocker is resolved or reframed.                |
| Trace Detail         | canonical | Trigger-scoped trace shown only for high-risk triggers or explicit user requests; it must not become a full Graph dump.            |
| Remaining judgment   | canonical | The visible assumptions, unknowns, risks, conflicts, Human Gate reasons, and accepted or deferred risks that affect user judgment. |
| Verification summary | canonical | Approval Brief section that summarizes required Checks, Evidence status, exceptions, and remaining verification judgment.          |

## Conditional Term Mapping

Some older documents may use canonical terms as projection labels rather than source artifacts. Read them carefully:

| Older Usage                                | Interpretation                                                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Product Tree used as a UI or analysis view | Treat as an Intent / Flow View or compatibility projection unless the file is a tree artifact. |
| Work Tree used as task-card grouping       | Treat as a Work View or View Tree Pack source unless it refers to `.pbe/tree/work-tree.json`.  |
| AI Context Pack used as execution input    | Treat as Execution Contract context shorthand.                                                 |

If a new canonical term seems necessary but does not have a basis in existing docs or the work instruction, record it as
an open question instead of adding it here.

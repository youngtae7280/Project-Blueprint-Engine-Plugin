# Read-Model E2E Smoke

Status: local-smoke-implemented / ci-observation-integrated / manual-and-pr-ci-reviewed / non-enforcing /
no-promotion-change

## Purpose

`npm run test:read-model:e2e` is a local dogfood smoke for the current configured Graph-source transition. It copies the
read-model examples into a temporary workspace, runs the CLI against that workspace, and removes the temporary files after
the run so the repository's generated artifacts do not churn.

The non-enforcing `PBE Read-Model Evidence` workflow now also runs the smoke and writes
`examples/read-model-aggregate/generated/read-model-e2e-smoke-output.json` as an uploaded observation artifact.

Manual workflow run `28223860233` reviewed the CI observation path after integration. The artifact manifest recorded
`e2eSmokeStatus: e2e-smoke-pass`, and the uploaded `read-model-e2e-smoke-output.json` confirmed Todo Search 40/59/7
with `projection-contract-pass`, Todo App 22/38/7 with `projection-contract-pass`, validate-all `aggregate-pass`, and
separate candidate observation `candidate-observation-pass`.

Manual workflow run `28348764191` reviewed the same E2E artifact after `report-intent` coverage was added. The uploaded
E2E output recorded `intentReport.status: intent-report-pass`, native/retrofit fixture summaries, nonzero
edgeIntent/claim/classification/anchor counts, and zero missing classification/anchor counts.

PR #12 run `28348903718` reviewed the same `intentReport` visibility through the non-enforcing
`pull_request-informational` path. The smoke PR was closed without merge, and the remote/local smoke branch plus temp
artifact download were cleaned up.

PR #8 run `28224088829` then reviewed the same E2E smoke visibility through the non-enforcing
`pull_request-informational` path. The smoke PR was closed without merge, and the remote/local smoke branch plus temp
artifact download were cleaned up.

The smoke checks:

- Todo Search graph-source-backed generation, 40 nodes / 59 edges / 7 Core Views
- Todo Search parity and validation pass
- Todo Search projection contract status `projection-contract-pass`
- Todo App PBE Run structure-only generation and validation, 22 nodes / 38 edges / 7 Core Views
- Todo App positive validate-all projection status `projection-contract-pass`
- registry-backed `graph read-model validate --all --json` status `aggregate-pass`
- `examples/read-model-aggregate/graph-source-transition-status.json` source roles and no-deletion/no-enforcement
  boundaries
- tree-native retirement readiness criteria/status: overall `retirement-not-ready`, Todo Search
  `deprecated-fallback-reference-not-deleted`, and Todo App `not-retirement-ready`
- tree-native retirement approval package statuses: Todo Search `retirement-candidate-not-deleted`, Todo App
  `not-ready-structure-only`, and repo-wide `not-ready`
- candidate observation status `candidate-observation-pass` as separate report-only metadata
- local `graph read-model report-intent --json` status `intent-report-pass`, with native/retrofit fixture summaries,
  nonzero edgeIntent/claim/classification/anchor counts, and zero missing classification/anchor counts
- local `graph read-model report-compiler-boundary --json` status `compiler-boundary-mvp-pass`
- local `graph read-model report-compiler-input --json` status `compiler-input-model-pass`
- local `graph read-model compile-contract --dry-run --json` status `contract-compiler-dry-run-pass`
- compiler dry-run generated-vs-hand-written diff status `contract-diff-detected`,
  `non-blocking-review-diff`, and `compiler-equivalence-not-proven`
- compiler dry-run semantic diff review status `compiler-promotion-not-ready`, with remaining allowed-scope
  conservative review debt visible as non-enforcing review metadata
- compiler dry-run v0.1 closeout metadata: `contract-compiler-dry-run-v0.1-classification-complete`,
  `semantic-diff-unknowns-zero`, `semanticDiffCoverageComplete: true`, and `equivalenceProven: false`
- output requirement source authority preview status `output-requirement-source-authority-preview-pass`, with
  `generated-output-requirements-preserved` and zero unresolved generated obligations visible as non-enforcing preview
  metadata
- contract source authority gap preview status `contract-source-authority-gap-preview-pass`, with remaining
  semantic/policy loss count and next recommended resolver visible as non-enforcing preview metadata. The current
  fixture preserves `forbiddenScope`, `stopConditions`, `requiredEvidence`, `requiredContext`, and `knownRisks` from
  source authority entries and recommends `allowed-scope-source-authority` next.

The separate `graph read-model report-health --json` command summarizes the same transition state from existing
artifacts and report surfaces. It is useful for a quick local health snapshot, while `npm run test:read-model:e2e`
remains the dogfood command that actually runs the end-to-end flow.

## Boundary

This local smoke is Evidence only. It does not add CI enforcement, required checks, repo-wide Graph-source promotion,
tree-native retirement, invalid fixture CI, or Todo App source-authority promotion.

# Scoped Source-Authority Pilot Review

Status: scoped-source-authority-pilot-review / scoped-pilot-review-pass-with-retained-warnings / source-authority-contained

## Document Purpose

This review observes whether the already recorded Todo Search scoped source-authority pilot remains safe as a bounded
judgment surface.

This is review-only. It does not expand pilot scope, approve full Graph-source promotion, retire tree-native artifacts,
introduce validator/CI enforcement, clean up public docs, or replace user acceptance authority.

## Review Outcome

```text
scoped-pilot-review-pass-with-retained-warnings
```

The scoped pilot is safe to keep active for the Todo Search selected slice because the generated interpretation boundary
remains bounded, generated/manual parity remains `comparison-pass`, tree-native fallback/reference artifacts remain
preserved, and retained warnings remain visible.

This review does not make the pilot suitable for broader execution or full promotion. Broader use still needs a separate
decision surface, and likely stronger validator/CI-backed Evidence before enforcement or repository-wide authority
changes.

## Required Review Questions

| Question                                                                            | Answer                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Did generated read-model interpretation stay bounded to Todo Search selected slice? | Yes. The pilot marker and execution record limit the interpretation boundary to `examples/internal-legacy/adoption/todo-search-slice`; the compatibility slice remains warning-only. |
| Did generated/manual parity remain `comparison-pass`?                               | Yes. The regenerated parity report remains `comparison-pass` with zero mismatches, zero blocking issues, and zero decision-required issues.                                          |
| Did fallback/reference tree-native artifacts remain preserved and usable?           | Yes. The Product, Project, Work, Test, Evidence, Acceptance, Change, and Impact artifacts remain present and are not retired or superseded.                                          |
| Did retained warnings remain visible?                                               | Yes. Bounded fixture scope, partial UI evidence, CI enforcement absence, and ACEP public-doc cleanup deferment remain carried forward.                                               |
| Did user acceptance authority remain user-controlled?                               | Yes. Demo-support Acceptance remains a user approval record and is not replaced by generated graph authority or Codex/PBE judgment.                                                  |
| Did the supplemental compatibility mismatch slice remain warning-only?              | Yes. It remains supplemental compatibility Evidence and is not included in the pilot source scope.                                                                                   |
| Is validator/CI-backed Evidence required before broader use?                        | Yes for broader execution, enforcement, or full promotion planning. It is not required to keep this bounded pilot active.                                                            |
| Is public-doc cleanup required before broader promotion, or still safely deferred?  | It is safely deferred for the current scoped pilot, but broader promotion should revisit whether cleanup becomes a blocker.                                                          |
| Is the scoped pilot safe to keep active?                                            | Yes, with retained warnings and fallback ready.                                                                                                                                      |

## Observation Summary

### Authority Boundary

The active pilot authority is limited to Graph-first Node/Edge/Tag interpretation and 7 Core View traversal for the Todo
Search selected slice. It does not make Maintainability Graph the repository-wide source model.

### Parity Stability

The generated/manual parity report remains stable after regeneration:

| Metric                     | Result            |
| -------------------------- | ----------------- |
| Final parity status        | `comparison-pass` |
| Mismatch count             | 0                 |
| Blocking count             | 0                 |
| Decision-required count    | 0                 |
| Generated/manual auto-fix? | No                |

### Fallback Readiness

Tree-native selected-slice artifacts remain the fallback/reference set. No retirement, deletion, or superseded marking is
performed by this review.

Fallback remains required if parity changes to warning/blocking/decision-required, retained warnings disappear, source
authority boundary text widens, Check/Evidence separation becomes ambiguous, or user acceptance authority appears
replaced by Codex/PBE.

### Retained Warnings

| Warning                                      | Review treatment                                                                 |
| -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Bounded fixture Evidence                     | Retained. Acceptable for this scoped pilot; not full Todo app implementation.    |
| Partial UI screenshot/manual visual Evidence | Retained. Acceptable for this scoped pilot; still not full visual proof.         |
| Validator/CI-backed Evidence missing         | Retained. Required before broader enforcement or stronger repeatability claims.  |
| ACEP task-card public-doc cleanup deferred   | Retained. Deferred for current pilot; revisit before broader promotion planning. |

| Validator/CI-backed repeatability  | Evidence Control Node        | later resolved for scoped pilot / enforcement future | This review did not introduce it; later local validator-backed and reviewed non-enforcing CI-backed Evidence were recorded for Todo Search. |

| Demo-support Acceptance            | Acceptance Control Node      | preserved with warnings                              | User acceptance remains user-controlled.                                                                                                    |

## Next Decision Surface

After this review, the user should choose among:

1. `Keep scoped pilot active and observe longer`
2. `Require validator/CI-backed Evidence before broader execution or enforcement`
3. `Perform public-doc cleanup`
4. `Prepare broader Graph-source promotion review`
5. `Rollback or defer scoped pilot`

Recommended next step: keep the scoped pilot active and observe longer. If the user wants to move beyond this bounded
pilot, validator/CI-backed Evidence should be considered before broader execution or enforcement.

The active observation criteria are recorded in
[scoped-source-authority-pilot-active-observation.md](scoped-source-authority-pilot-active-observation.md). That record
keeps the pilot active with retained warnings and defines re-review, fallback/defer, validator/CI, public-doc cleanup,
and broader-promotion triggers without executing any next-phase action.

[validator-ci-backed-read-model-evidence-design.md](validator-ci-backed-read-model-evidence-design.md) defines the
validator/CI-backed Evidence design for broader use. It does not introduce enforcement or change the current scoped pilot
status.

| Source Authority Containment Gate        | Pass   | Authority remains bounded to Todo Search selected slice.   |
| Parity Stability Gate                    | Pass   | Parity remains `comparison-pass`.                          |
| Fallback Readiness Gate                  | Pass   | Tree-native fallback/reference artifacts remain preserved. |

| User Acceptance Authority Gate           | Pass   | User acceptance remains user-controlled.                   |
| Supplemental Compatibility Boundary Gate | Pass   | Compatibility mismatch slice remains warning-only.         |
| Validator/CI Boundary Gate               | Pass   | No validator/CI enforcement introduced.                    |
| Public-Doc Cleanup Boundary Gate         | Pass   | No public-doc cleanup performed.                           |
| Non-Full-Promotion Gate                  | Pass   | Full Graph-source promotion remains unapproved.            |

## Final Non-Promotion Statement

This review keeps the Todo Search scoped pilot observable and bounded. It does not approve full Graph-source promotion,
does not expand source authority, does not retire tree-native artifacts, does not introduce validator/CI enforcement,
does not clean up public docs, and does not authorize Codex/PBE to replace user acceptance authority.

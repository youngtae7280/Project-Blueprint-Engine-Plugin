# Contract Compiler Calibration Fixtures

Status: planning / non-enforcing / calibration fixture selection

## Purpose

This note tracks calibration fixture selection for DevView Contract Compiler Dry-Run generalization.

The current Todo Search whitespace-normalization `bug_fix` fixture proves that one bounded fixture can move through:

```text
Compiler Input Model
-> deterministic contract candidate
-> Contract Fixture Validator
-> semantic diff classification
-> source-authority reconstruction
-> promotion review packet
-> current-fixture human decision record
```

That does not prove the compiler generalizes. The next milestone should observe a second fixture with a different shape
before adding broad compiler support.

## Current Baseline

The current baseline remains the Todo Search whitespace-normalization `bug_fix` dry-run fixture:

- input: `examples/read-model-aggregate/generated/compiler-input-model-dry-run.json`
- generated candidate: `examples/read-model-aggregate/generated/execution-contract-dry-run.generated.json`
- comparison fixture: `examples/read-model-aggregate/generated/execution-contract-dry-run.json`
- semantic diff: `examples/read-model-aggregate/generated/execution-contract-dry-run.diff.json`
- promotion review packet:
  `examples/read-model-aggregate/generated/contract-compiler-promotion-review.preview.json`
- human decision record:
  `docs/concept/contract-compiler-promotion-decision-current-fixture.md`

Current baseline status:

- `equivalenceCandidate: true`
- `equivalenceProven: false`
- generated `approvalStatus` remains not approved
- human decision scope is current fixture, current generated candidate, and current promotion review packet only

## Candidate Scan

| Candidate                                                                  | Calibration value                                                                                                        | Decision                                                                                                       |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Todo Search whitespace-normalization `bug_fix`                             | Baseline fixture with complete source-authority reconstruction.                                                          | Not selected because it is the baseline.                                                                       |
| `examples/valid/todo-app-pbe-run`                                          | Existing read-model structure fixture with positive validate-all coverage.                                               | Deferred because it is structure-only and lacks a different behavior/evidence contract.                        |
| `examples/retrofit/cardprinterconfig`                                      | Realistic retrofit records with UI/hardware-adjacent scope and local validation records.                                 | Deferred because it is larger, hardware-adjacent, and less suitable as the first compiler calibration fixture. |
| `examples/retrofit/open-source/kubernetes-sidecar-kep`                     | Large external design-doc retrofit with formal KEP context.                                                              | Deferred because it is read-only and too broad for the first second-fixture calibration pass.                  |
| `examples/retrofit/open-source/escape-html` plus `outputs/.../escape-html` | Existing external behavior-change dogfood with graph source, instruction pack, graph delta, proposal, and test evidence. | Selected as the second calibration fixture candidate.                                                          |

## Selected Calibration Fixture

Selected fixture:

```text
component/escape-html Symbol stringification behavior-change dogfood
```

Primary paths:

- `docs/concept/real-external-behavior-change-dogfood.md`
- `examples/retrofit/open-source/escape-html/graph-source.json`
- `examples/retrofit/open-source/escape-html/records/symbol-stringification.implemented.json`
- `examples/retrofit/open-source/escape-html/generated/compiler-input-model-calibration-draft.json`
- `outputs/retrofit/open-source/escape-html/instruction-packs/symbol-stringification.instruction-pack.json`
- `outputs/retrofit/open-source/escape-html/graph-deltas/symbol-stringification.graph-delta.json`
- `outputs/retrofit/open-source/escape-html/graph-update-proposals/symbol-stringification.graph-update-proposal.json`
- `outputs/retrofit/open-source/escape-html/dogfood-report.json`

Why this fixture is different:

- It is an external retrofit dogfood, not an internal Todo Search adoption fixture.
- It records a real code/test behavior change in a local external checkout.
- It recovers intent from README, source, tests, and graph edges.
- It includes an instruction pack, graph delta, graph update proposal, and dogfood report.
- Its boundaries include no upstream PR, no maintainer approval claim, no package metadata change, and no escaping
  vocabulary change.
- Its Evidence shape is an external project test suite result (`npm test`, 31 passing tests), not the Todo Search runtime
  fixture chain.

## Calibration Input Draft

The first input-model draft is:

```text
examples/retrofit/open-source/escape-html/generated/compiler-input-model-calibration-draft.json
```

The first static observation report is:

```text
examples/retrofit/open-source/escape-html/generated/compiler-input-calibration-observation.preview.json
```

The first behavior-change calibration policy preview is:

```text
examples/retrofit/open-source/escape-html/generated/behavior-change-calibration-policy.preview.json
```

The first external required-check binding preview is:

```text
examples/retrofit/open-source/escape-html/generated/external-required-check-binding.preview.json
```

The first external checkout path authority preview is:

```text
examples/retrofit/open-source/escape-html/generated/external-checkout-path-authority.preview.json
```

The first anchor-level context preview is:

```text
examples/retrofit/open-source/escape-html/generated/anchor-level-context.preview.json
```

The first risk vocabulary preview is:

```text
examples/retrofit/open-source/escape-html/generated/risk-vocabulary.preview.json
```

The first graph-delta review binding preview is:

```text
examples/retrofit/open-source/escape-html/generated/graph-delta-review-binding.preview.json
```

This draft is `calibration-draft`, `not-supported`, `not-approved`, and `equivalenceProven: false`. It is not wired into
`graph read-model compile-contract --dry-run`, does not create a promotion review packet for the second fixture, and is
not an execution source.

Inputs that can be represented with the current shape:

- `humanRequest` from the external behavior-change dogfood record;
- `graphSnapshot.artifacts[]` for graph source, change record, instruction pack, graph delta, graph update proposal, and
  dogfood report;
- `targetScopeCandidates[]` for `index.js`, `test/index.js`, and review Evidence artifacts;
- `policySnapshot.forbiddenScopeRules[]` for escaping vocabulary, package metadata, upstream approval, and graph-delta
  apply boundaries;
- `evidenceIndex.entries[]` for `npm test`, dogfood report, graph delta, and graph update proposal artifacts;
- `outputRequirementSources[]` for changed files, command Evidence status, validation summary, and non-upstream boundary
  reporting;
- `stopConditionSources[]` for missing external checkout/tests, scope expansion, and unsupported current compiler check
  bindings;
- `riskSources[]` for scope drift and source-authority loss.

Known draft gaps:

- The current compiler input command surface still reads only the Todo Search dry-run fixture.
- External project check IDs such as `check-escape-html-npm-test` are previewed as calibration-only bindings but are
  not in the current required-check registry.
- `work/external/escape-html` paths are previewed as calibration-local source context, not portable compiler support
  authority.
- Anchor-level code/test context is previewed from static record anchors, not supported compiler context.
- Behavior-change risk vocabulary is previewed, but it does not prove mitigation or support.
- Graph-delta review binding is previewed, but it does not apply graph deltas or prove equivalence.
- The source dogfood is behavior-change shaped and is now recognized as calibration-only policy while still using the
  current `bug_fix` vocabulary; this does not add arbitrary `changeType` support.
- Graph delta and graph update proposal artifacts are review Evidence, not graph apply authority.

Expected resolver behavior:

- Existing output requirement, forbidden scope, stop condition, Evidence, context, risk, and allowed-scope resolver
  concepts should be reusable in shape.
- External checkout path handling and external required-check binding are expected to block or require a calibration
  extension.
- If this draft is wired in a future v0.3 task, the correct first result may be `not-supported` or `blocked` with
  precise source-authority gaps, not a successful candidate.

## Calibration Observation

The observation preview classifies the second fixture as:

- `fixtureStatus: calibration-draft`
- `supportStatus: not-supported`
- `behaviorChangeCalibrationPolicyStatus: behavior-change-calibration-policy-recognized`
- `compileEligibility: not-eligible-current-command-not-wired`
- `expectedCandidateStatus: contract-candidate-not-run`
- `promotionEligibility.status: promotion-not-eligible`
- `equivalenceProven: false`

This is the intended current result. Behavior-change shape is now recognized as a calibration policy boundary, but the
observation does not compile a candidate and does not ask the current compiler-supported Todo Search path to accept the
second fixture.

The current source-authority model appears reusable in concept for:

- `outputRequirements`, with graph delta bindings kept review-only;
- `forbiddenScope`, with external-retrofit policy boundaries;
- `stopConditions`, with missing external checkout/check handling;
- `requiredContext`, at artifact level.

The observation reports likely extensions for:

- external required-check registry binding, now previewed but awaiting authoritative checkout modeling;
- external checkout path authority, now previewed as calibration-local and non-portable;
- escaping/stringification and maintainer-approval risk vocabulary, now previewed but not mitigation proof;
- README/source/test anchor-level context, now previewed approximately but not supported;
- graph delta and graph update proposal review-output binding, now previewed as review-only.

Recommended v0.3 direction:

```text
v0.3-calibration-closeout-decision
```

External required-check binding and external checkout path authority are now previewed as non-enforcing calibration
Evidence, anchor-level context is previewed from static record anchors, and risk vocabulary is previewed as review
metadata. Graph-delta review binding is also previewed as review-only output/reporting metadata. The next step should
close out the v0.3 escape-html calibration preview gap set before candidate generation, promotion review,
behavior-change support, broad pack schema expansion, or any execution/enforcement work.

## External Required-Check Binding Preview

The external required-check binding preview maps the escape-html draft's proof obligations to observed dogfood Evidence
without turning them into supported compiler required checks:

- `check-escape-html-npm-test` maps to the observed `npm test` result in
  `outputs/retrofit/open-source/escape-html/dogfood-report.json`;
- `check-escape-html-dogfood-validator` maps to the dogfood validator summary in the same report;
- `check-escape-html-graph-delta-review` maps to graph delta review artifacts as review-only Evidence, not graph delta
  apply authority.

The preview status is:

```text
external-required-check-binding-awaiting-authoritative-checkout
```

This means the required-check shape is visible, but the check authority is not established for support. The external
checkout path `work/external/escape-html` is previewed as calibration-local source context, not portable execution or
compiler support authority.

This preview is not:

- a CI job;
- a GitHub required check;
- a branch protection rule;
- a supported compiler check registry entry;
- a promotion approval;
- user acceptance;
- execution authority.

## External Checkout Path Authority Preview

The external checkout path authority preview describes `work/external/escape-html` using static dogfood metadata:

- expected project: `component/escape-html`;
- expected upstream: `https://github.com/component/escape-html`;
- observed checkout path: `work/external/escape-html`;
- observed clone head: `b42947eefa79efff01b3fe988c4c7e7b051ec8d8`;
- observed dirty files: `index.js` and `test/index.js`.

The preview status is:

```text
external-checkout-path-authority-previewed-calibration-local
```

This establishes only that the calibration artifacts consistently describe the same local external checkout. It does
not independently verify repository identity, make the local path portable, prove a clean baseline, or permit command
execution.

The checkout authority preview may be used to explain why external required-check binding is waiting for authoritative
checkout modeling. It must not be used as:

- permission to run external checks;
- permission to modify external files;
- supported compiler source authority;
- CI enforcement;
- branch protection;
- promotion approval;
- graph delta apply authority.

## Anchor-Level Context Preview

The anchor-level context preview describes the specific source and test behavior anchors behind the Symbol
stringification calibration fixture. File-level context is too broad here because the behavior change depends on a
narrow input-coercion point and nearby verification surfaces:

- source coercion before the dogfood: `var str = '' + string`;
- source coercion observed after the dogfood: `var str = String(string)`;
- existing non-string stringification tests such as `when string is undefined`;
- new Symbol assertion Evidence: `escapeHtml(Symbol('escape')) === 'Symbol(escape)'`;
- existing escape-vocabulary guard tests such as `when string contains "&"`.

The preview status is:

```text
anchor-level-context-previewed-approximate
```

This means the available static records identify behavior anchors, but exact line ranges are not verified and the local
external checkout remains non-portable. The anchors are review metadata only.

The anchor-level context preview is not:

- edit permission;
- supported compiler context;
- source checkout authority;
- candidate generation;
- promotion approval;
- execution authority.

## Risk Vocabulary Preview

The risk vocabulary preview names behavior-change-specific risks for the escape-html calibration fixture without
claiming they are mitigated. It uses the approximate anchors and observed Evidence to make risk review more precise than
generic `scope-drift` or `source-authority-loss` labels.

Previewed risk terms include:

- `runtime-compatibility-risk`;
- `input-coercion-behavior-risk`;
- `symbol-handling-regression-risk`;
- `escaping-correctness-risk`;
- `non-string-input-behavior-drift`;
- `test-coverage-insufficiency-risk`;
- `source-authority-boundary-risk`.

The preview status is:

```text
risk-vocabulary-previewed
```

This means the vocabulary can inform later graph-delta review and compliance checking. It does not prove risk
mitigation, does not make the fixture supported, and does not approve behavior-change support.

The risk vocabulary preview is not:

- final compiler risk policy;
- mitigation proof;
- promotion approval;
- user acceptance;
- CI enforcement;
- behavior-change support.

## Graph-Delta Review Binding Preview

The graph-delta review binding preview describes how the Symbol stringification behavior-change should be reviewed as a
graph delta. It binds the existing graph delta and graph update proposal artifacts to review questions without applying
them.

The expected review shape focuses on:

- input coercion behavior change;
- Symbol input handling;
- escaping correctness preservation;
- existing non-string input behavior relationship;
- test evidence relationship;
- source-authority boundary.

The preview status is:

```text
graph-delta-review-binding-previewed
```

This means the fixture now has review metadata connecting changed files, graph nodes, graph edges, behavior anchors,
risk terms, and Evidence. It does not apply graph deltas, mutate graph source, prove semantic equivalence, or make the
fixture supported.

The graph-delta review binding preview is not:

- graph delta apply;
- graph source mutation;
- semantic equivalence proof;
- candidate generation;
- promotion approval;
- execution authority.

## v0.3 Scope Decision

The first v0.3 scope is:

```text
behavior-change pack schema policy
```

This scope is now implemented as calibration-only policy recognition. The second fixture remains `not-supported`,
`not-eligible-current-command-not-wired`, `contract-candidate-not-run`, `not-approved`, and `equivalenceProven: false`.

Why this scope comes first:

- the selected `escape-html` fixture is behavior-change shaped;
- the completed current fixture is `bug_fix` shaped;
- the calibration draft currently keeps `changeType: bug_fix` only as a compatibility assumption;
- before external checks, external paths, risk detail, or graph-delta review bindings can be promoted, DevView needs a
  policy boundary for behavior-change calibration inputs;
- without that policy boundary, later resolver work could accidentally look like arbitrary behavior-change support.

Observed gap comparison:

| Gap                                | Why it matters                                                                                      | Blocks compile eligibility | Blocks source-authority reconstruction | Blocks promotion review | Expected implementation risk | Ordering decision                                     |

| Risk vocabulary                    | Keeps escaping/stringification and maintainer-approval risks visible without ad hoc prose.          | no                         | partial                                | maybe                   | medium                       | after eligibility; before candidate promotion         |
| Graph-delta review binding         | Keeps graph delta/proposal outputs review-only and distinct from graph apply authority.             | no                         | partial                                | maybe                   | medium                       | after eligibility; before any graph-delta integration |

The selected scope is deliberately narrow. It should define how a behavior-change calibration draft is identified,
reported, and held outside support. It should not make `compile-contract --dry-run` compile the second fixture as a
supported candidate.

Implemented output for this first v0.3 scope:

- the calibration observation can distinguish `behavior-change-calibration-policy-recognized` from arbitrary
  `unsupported-change-type-shape`;
- the fixture remains `not-supported`;
- expected candidate status remains `contract-candidate-not-run`;
- unsupported/blocked reasons become clearer;
- external required-check binding, external checkout path authority, anchor-level context, risk vocabulary, and
  graph-delta review binding remain future scopes;
- no promotion review packet is created for the second fixture.

Follow-up output after v0.3 calibration previews:

- `external-required-check-binding.preview.json` records candidate mappings for `npm test`, dogfood validation, and
  graph-delta review Evidence;
- `external-checkout-path-authority.preview.json` records the calibration-local checkout context for
  `work/external/escape-html`;
- `anchor-level-context.preview.json` records approximate source/test behavior anchors for Symbol stringification;
- `risk-vocabulary.preview.json` records behavior-change risk terms and maps them to anchors and Evidence without
  proving mitigation;
- `graph-delta-review-binding.preview.json` records review-only graph delta questions and keeps graph apply out of
  scope;
- the observation reports `external-required-check-binding-awaiting-authoritative-checkout` and
  `external-checkout-path-authority-previewed-calibration-local`;
- the observation reports `anchor-level-context-previewed-approximate`;
- the observation reports `risk-vocabulary-previewed`;
- the observation reports `graph-delta-review-binding-previewed`;
- the observation reports `v0.3-calibration-preview-gap-set-complete`;
- the fixture remains `not-supported`, `not-eligible-current-command-not-wired`, `contract-candidate-not-run`,
  `not-approved`, and `equivalenceProven: false`;
- no observed v0.3 calibration preview gap remains hidden as support.

Non-goals for the first v0.3 scope:

- no arbitrary behavior-change support;
- no supported external required-check binding or CI/branch-protection enforcement;
- no supported external checkout path authority or execution permission;
- no supported anchor-level context resolver or edit permission;
- no final compiler risk policy or mitigation proof;
- no graph delta apply or semantic equivalence proof;
- no second fixture support or approval;
- no `equivalenceProven: true`;
- no executor automation, graph delta apply, CI enforcement, required checks, branch protection, user acceptance
  automation, or tree-native retirement.

## What It Should Exercise

The selected fixture should exercise these source-authority surfaces in a later calibration cycle:

- `allowedScope`: external local project files `index.js` and `test/index.js`, derived from instruction-pack and graph
  record boundaries.
- `requiredContext`: README/source/test intent nodes such as `module.escape-html-function`,
  `surface.stringification-tests`, and `surface.special-character-tests`.
- `requiredEvidence`: external project test evidence from `npm test` and the dogfood report.
- `forbiddenScope`: no escaping vocabulary change, no package metadata or dependency change, no README/API wording
  change, no benchmark change, and no upstream PR or maintainer approval claim.
- `stopConditions`: missing external checkout, missing baseline install/test evidence, dirty files outside selected
  scope, missing graph source record, missing test command evidence, or upstream approval claims.
- `knownRisks`: stringification semantics regression, escaping/security regression, upstream compatibility claims,
  package metadata drift, and graph proposal being mistaken for direct graph-source mutation.
- `outputRequirements`: changed-file summary, command-output Evidence status, graph delta/proposal status, and
  non-upstream-approval boundary statement.

## Expected Source-Authority Gaps

This task does not implement the second fixture. The first calibration run should expect gaps such as:

- no committed Compiler Input Model fixture for `escape-html` yet;
- required Evidence/check mapping for external project commands now has a preview-only binding, but still needs checkout
  path authority before support can be considered;
- checkout path authority now has a calibration-local preview, but still needs a separate portable authority policy
  before support can be considered;
- required context now has approximate graph-node-to-source/test/README anchor mapping, but still needs exact line and
  portable source authority before support can be considered;
- known risks now have preview vocabulary, but still need evidence-backed mitigation review before support can be
  considered;
- forbidden scope and stop condition sources may need external-retrofit boundary vocabulary;
- graph delta and graph update proposal artifacts now have review-only bindings, but still need a human closeout
  decision before any support work can be considered.

These gaps should be reported as calibration findings, not hidden as support.

## Expected Semantic Diff Behavior

Before input modeling exists, the compiler should either not run for this fixture or produce a precise blocked/not-run
reason. It should not claim support for the fixture.

After a narrow Compiler Input Model candidate is authored in a future task, the expected behavior is:

- generated candidate production is non-executing;
- Contract Fixture Validator remains the validator boundary;
- semantic diff classification reports meaningful field differences or source-authority gaps;
- source-authority gap preview identifies the next resolver or input-model extension;
- `equivalenceProven` remains `false`;
- promotion review remains non-enforcing and fixture-scoped.

## v0.3 Calibration Preview Closeout

The v0.3 escape-html calibration preview cycle is closed as observation-complete for the selected second fixture:

```text
previewGapSetStatus: v0.3-calibration-preview-gap-set-complete
```

This closeout means the observed calibration gaps now have reviewable preview artifacts. It does not mean the second
fixture is supported, compile-eligible, approved, or equivalence-proven.

Completed preview axes:

- behavior-change calibration policy:
  `examples/retrofit/open-source/escape-html/generated/behavior-change-calibration-policy.preview.json`
- external required-check binding:
  `examples/retrofit/open-source/escape-html/generated/external-required-check-binding.preview.json`
- external checkout path authority:
  `examples/retrofit/open-source/escape-html/generated/external-checkout-path-authority.preview.json`
- anchor-level context:
  `examples/retrofit/open-source/escape-html/generated/anchor-level-context.preview.json`
- risk vocabulary:
  `examples/retrofit/open-source/escape-html/generated/risk-vocabulary.preview.json`
- graph-delta review binding:
  `examples/retrofit/open-source/escape-html/generated/graph-delta-review-binding.preview.json`

Current second-fixture status remains:

- `supportStatus: not-supported`
- `compileEligibility: not-eligible-current-command-not-wired`
- `expectedCandidateStatus: contract-candidate-not-run`
- `approvalStatus: not-approved`
- `equivalenceProven: false`

Closed preview gaps:

- DevView can recognize the fixture as behavior-change shaped for calibration only.
- DevView can preview external required-check binding candidates.
- DevView can describe the external checkout as calibration-local source context.
- DevView can preview approximate source/test anchors for the behavior change.
- DevView can name behavior-change-specific risks without claiming mitigation.
- DevView can bind graph delta and graph update proposal artifacts to review-only questions.

Unresolved support blockers:

- external checkout authority remains calibration-local, non-portable, and non-enforcing;
- required-check binding still awaits an authoritative checkout and supported check registry decision;
- anchor-level context remains approximate and lacks exact line/source authority;
- risk vocabulary is not mitigation proof or final compiler risk policy;
- graph-delta review binding is review-only and does not apply graph deltas;
- no supported Compiler Input Model is committed for this fixture;
- no contract candidate is generated for this fixture;
- no promotion review packet or human approval exists for this fixture.

Closeout decision:

```text
close-v0.3-escape-html-calibration-preview-cycle
```

The preview observation cycle is closed for the second fixture, but the fixture is not promoted to supported. The preview
artifacts should stay non-enforcing calibration evidence. They should not be moved into general compiler report
generation, command wiring, or candidate generation without a separate decision.

Recommended next step:

```text
select-third-calibration-fixture
```

Reason: a third fixture should reduce overfitting risk before any of the preview concepts are promoted into general
report generation or compiler behavior.

Closeout non-goals:

- no second-fixture support;
- no compiler command wiring;
- no contract candidate generation;
- no external required checks;
- no graph delta apply;
- no graph source mutation;
- no promotion review packet or approval;
- no semantic equivalence claim;
- no risk mitigation proof;
- no CI enforcement, required checks, branch protection, user acceptance automation, or tree-native retirement.

## Third Calibration Fixture Selection

Selected third calibration fixture:

```text
Todo App add-todo runtime evidence-only calibration
```

Fixture shape:

```text
test-only behavior proof
```

Primary source surfaces:

- `examples/valid/todo-app-pbe-run/graph-source.json`
- `examples/valid/todo-app-pbe-run/.pbe/tree/product-tree.json`
- `examples/valid/todo-app-pbe-run/.pbe/tree/work-tree.json`
- `examples/valid/todo-app-pbe-run/.pbe/tree/test-tree.json`
- `examples/valid/todo-app-pbe-run/.pbe/evidence/evidence-tree.json`
- `examples/valid/todo-app-pbe-run/.pbe/evidence/test-results/todo-add.txt`
- `docs/concept/todo-app-source-authority-evidence-package.md`

This selection does not promote the existing Todo App positive fixture beyond its current structure-only role. It
selects a future calibration target shaped around proving behavior through test and Evidence surfaces while production
source edits remain out of scope.

Initial expected statuses:

- `fixtureStatus: calibration-fixture-selected`
- `supportStatus: not-supported`
- `expectedCandidateStatus: contract-candidate-not-run`
- `approvalStatus: not-approved`
- `equivalenceProven: false`

Why this fixture was selected:

- The current Todo Search fixture validated source-authority reconstruction for a local `bug_fix`.
- The `escape-html` fixture explored external `behavior-change` preview concepts.
- The third fixture should stress a different shape where test/Evidence scope is primary and production source changes
  are not allowed.
- Todo App already has Product, Work, Test, Evidence, Acceptance, and structure-only graph-source surfaces, plus an
  explicit evidence package explaining why runtime behavior proof is still missing.

Compiler dimensions this should stress:

- test-only allowed scope, with future edits limited to test or Evidence artifacts;
- production-source forbidden scope, especially `src/todos.ts` and any app implementation file;
- required Evidence and check binding as the central obligation;
- output requirements that report test Evidence status instead of source implementation changes;
- stop conditions when satisfying the test-only proof would require production source edits;
- compliance-checker bridge for detecting forbidden production source changes;
- user acceptance boundary, because test Evidence still cannot accept product results.

Expected future gaps to observe:

- how `allowedScope` represents test/Evidence-only work;
- how `forbiddenScope` blocks production source changes even when behavior proof is missing;
- how `requiredEvidence` and check mappings distinguish attached text Evidence from runnable test proof;
- how `outputRequirements` report a proof-only result without implying implementation authority;
- how `stopConditions` represent "source edit required" as a blocker for a test-only proof fixture;
- how a later compliance checker could detect production source drift against the test-only contract.

Expected non-support boundary:

The third fixture starts as planning-only. It is not wired into `graph read-model compile-contract --dry-run`, does not
generate a contract candidate, does not create a promotion review packet, does not approve Todo App promotion, and does
not change the existing `todo-app-pbe-run-structure-only` registry meaning.

Overfitting risk reduction:

This fixture should reduce overfitting risk because it is neither the completed local code-change fixture nor the
external behavior-change preview fixture. It asks whether DevView can reason about a proof-focused task where the safest
contract may forbid production code edits and require only test/Evidence strengthening.

## Third Calibration Input Draft

The third fixture calibration-only input draft is:

```text
examples/valid/todo-app-pbe-run/generated/compiler-input-model-calibration-draft.runtime-evidence-only.json
```

Draft status:

- `fixtureStatus: calibration-draft`
- `fixtureShape: test-only-behavior-proof`
- `supportStatus: not-supported`
- `expectedCandidateStatus: contract-candidate-not-run`
- `approvalStatus: not-approved`
- `equivalenceProven: false`

This draft is intentionally placed beside the existing Todo App generated artifacts, but it does not overwrite or
reinterpret the existing `todo-app-pbe-run-structure-only` fixture. The positive Todo App fixture remains
structure-only; the draft is a separate calibration artifact for a possible future runtime Evidence-only proof.

The draft models:

- allowed test/Evidence-oriented scope through `.pbe/tree/test-tree.json`, `.pbe/evidence/evidence-tree.json`, and
  `.pbe/evidence/test-results/todo-add.txt`;
- forbidden production source scope through the conceptual `src/todos.ts` path from `WT-1`;
- required runtime command Evidence as missing/unresolved rather than satisfied;
- attached structure-only Evidence as present but not authoritative runtime proof;
- output requirements for runtime Evidence status, production source non-modification, and non-promotion boundaries;
- stop conditions when runtime proof would require production source edits, when runtime command Evidence is missing, or
  when Evidence is treated as user acceptance;
- risk sources for test-only scope drift, attached-Evidence authority confusion, and acceptance-boundary confusion.

This draft should help a later calibration cycle observe compliance-checker-adjacent questions, especially whether a
test-only contract can detect forbidden production source edits. It is not a supported Compiler Input Model, does not
generate a contract candidate, does not create a promotion review packet, and does not approve Todo App promotion.

## Third Calibration Observation Preview

The third fixture calibration observation preview is:

```text
examples/valid/todo-app-pbe-run/generated/compiler-input-calibration-observation.runtime-evidence-only.preview.json
```

Observation status:

- `status: runtime-evidence-only-calibration-observation-previewed`
- `supportStatus: not-supported`
- `compileEligibility: not-eligible-current-command-not-wired`
- `expectedCandidateStatus: contract-candidate-not-run`
- `approvalStatus: not-approved`
- `equivalenceProven: false`

The observation keeps the runtime Evidence-only fixture distinct from the existing Todo App structure-only positive
fixture. It is preview-only and non-enforcing, and it is not supported compiler output.

Observed gaps:

- `test-only-allowed-scope`;
- `production-source-forbidden-scope`;
- `runtime-evidence-authority`;
- `evidence-check-binding`;
- `output-requirement-for-test-evidence`;
- `stop-condition-when-source-edits-needed`;
- `compliance-checker-bridge`.

Core test-only boundary:

- production source changes are forbidden or out of scope;
- runtime behavior must be proven through test or Evidence output;
- if production source edits appear necessary, the correct behavior is to stop rather than silently expand scope;
- the fixture is useful for future compliance checking because forbidden source edits should be detectable.

The observation marks attached structure-only Evidence as present but not authoritative runtime proof. It also marks
runtime command Evidence and production source non-modification Evidence as unresolved. It does not invent passing
Evidence, does not create a contract candidate, and does not approve Todo App promotion.

## Third Test-Only Scope Boundary Preview

The third fixture test-only scope boundary preview is:

```text
examples/valid/todo-app-pbe-run/generated/test-only-scope-boundary.runtime-evidence-only.preview.json
```

Preview status:

- `status: test-only-scope-boundary-previewed`
- `scopeBoundaryStatus: preview-only-non-enforcing`
- `productionSourceBoundaryStatus: production-source-edit-forbidden-or-stop-required`
- `supportStatus: not-supported`
- `expectedCandidateStatus: contract-candidate-not-run`
- `approvalStatus: not-approved`
- `equivalenceProven: false`

The preview narrows the third fixture's core boundary:

- allowed or candidate scope is test/Evidence oriented;
- runtime command output and source non-modification reports remain unresolved candidate Evidence/report surfaces;
- production source edits are forbidden, out of scope, or stop-required;
- Todo App profile promotion and acceptance-state mutation are forbidden;
- silent expansion from proof-only work into production implementation work is not allowed.

If runtime behavior cannot be proven without production source edits, the expected review behavior is:

```text
stop
report that production source edits appear necessary
do not silently modify production source
request a separate human scope decision
```

This is a preview policy only. It does not enforce scope, execute checks, edit files, generate a candidate, satisfy
runtime Evidence, approve promotion, or replace user acceptance. It prepares the fixture for later compliance-checker
work by making forbidden production source edits explicit and reviewable.

Updated third-fixture gap statuses:

- `test-only-allowed-scope`: `test-only-scope-boundary-previewed`
- `production-source-forbidden-scope`: `production-source-boundary-previewed`
- `stop-condition-when-source-edits-needed`: `source-edit-stop-condition-previewed`

Still unresolved:

- `runtime-evidence-authority`;
- `evidence-check-binding`;
- `output-requirement-for-test-evidence`;
- `compliance-checker-bridge`.

## Third Runtime Evidence Authority Preview

The third fixture runtime Evidence authority preview is:

```text
examples/valid/todo-app-pbe-run/generated/runtime-evidence-authority.runtime-evidence-only.preview.json
```

Preview status:

- `status: runtime-evidence-authority-previewed`
- `runtimeEvidenceAuthorityStatus: preview-only-not-satisfied`
- `currentRuntimeEvidenceStatus: missing`
- `supportStatus: not-supported`
- `expectedCandidateStatus: contract-candidate-not-run`
- `approvalStatus: not-approved`
- `equivalenceProven: false`

The preview defines what may count as authoritative runtime Evidence for the test-only behavior proof fixture. Candidate
authoritative Evidence can include captured command output, structured runtime test artifacts, or manual runtime
observation records with human review. Natural-language claims such as "tests passed" are not authoritative Evidence by
themselves.

Authoritative runtime Evidence should record:

- exact command or runtime check;
- pass/fail status and exit code where applicable;
- relevant assertion summary;
- artifact path or structured evidence record;
- freshness or capture statement;
- links to `TT-1`, `AC-PT-1-1`, and the add-todo behavior;
- source non-modification statement.

The existing attached `todo-add.txt` remains structure-only context. It is present, but it is not enough by itself to
satisfy runtime Evidence authority for this calibration fixture. Runtime command Evidence and production source
non-modification Evidence remain unresolved.

The preview preserves the test-only boundary: runtime Evidence must be produced without production source edits. If
production source edits appear necessary, the expected behavior remains stop and report, not silent scope expansion.

Updated third-fixture gap status:

- `runtime-evidence-authority`: `runtime-evidence-authority-previewed`

Still unresolved:

- `evidence-check-binding`;
- `output-requirement-for-test-evidence`;
- `compliance-checker-bridge`.

## Third Evidence-Check Binding Preview

The third fixture evidence-check binding preview is:

```text
examples/valid/todo-app-pbe-run/generated/evidence-check-binding.runtime-evidence-only.preview.json
```

Preview status:

- `status: evidence-check-binding-previewed`
- `evidenceCheckBindingStatus: preview-only-not-satisfied`
- `currentRuntimeEvidenceStatus: missing`
- `supportStatus: not-supported`
- `expectedCandidateStatus: contract-candidate-not-run`
- `approvalStatus: not-approved`
- `equivalenceProven: false`

The preview maps candidate checks to expected Evidence without making those checks required checks:

- `check-todo-app-runtime-add-todo` -> missing authoritative runtime command Evidence;
- `check-todo-app-attached-evidence-review` -> present attached structure-only Evidence, not runtime proof;
- `check-todo-app-production-source-unchanged` -> missing future source non-modification Evidence.

Candidate checks must produce Evidence satisfying the runtime Evidence authority preview. Because current runtime
Evidence is still missing, the binding is not satisfied. No command is claimed to have passed, and no check is wired into
CI, branch protection, or the supported compiler command path.

The preview preserves the test-only boundary: checks and Evidence must not require production source edits. If production
source edits appear necessary, the expected behavior remains stop and report, not silent scope expansion.

Updated third-fixture gap status:

- `evidence-check-binding`: `evidence-check-binding-previewed`

Still unresolved before the output requirement preview:

- `output-requirement-for-test-evidence`;
- `compliance-checker-bridge`.

## Third Output Requirement For Test Evidence Preview

The third fixture output requirement preview is:

```text
examples/valid/todo-app-pbe-run/generated/output-requirement-for-test-evidence.runtime-evidence-only.preview.json
```

Preview status:

- `status: output-requirement-for-test-evidence-previewed`
- `outputRequirementStatus: preview-only-not-satisfied`
- `currentRuntimeEvidenceStatus: missing`
- `evidenceCheckBindingStatus: preview-only-not-satisfied`
- `supportStatus: not-supported`
- `expectedCandidateStatus: contract-candidate-not-run`
- `approvalStatus: not-approved`
- `equivalenceProven: false`

The preview defines what an agent must report after a test-only behavior proof attempt without turning that report into
runtime Evidence by itself. Required report content includes:

- whether candidate checks were attempted, skipped, or unavailable;
- captured command output references or an explicit missing Evidence status;
- current runtime Evidence status;
- whether available Evidence satisfies runtime Evidence authority requirements;
- whether production source files were modified;
- whether the source-edit stop condition was triggered;
- the non-promotion, non-approval, and non-acceptance boundary for this calibration fixture.

Report text alone is insufficient without command output or structured Evidence references. The output requirement also
keeps the structure-only attached Evidence boundary visible: the existing attached Evidence can be referenced as context,
but it does not satisfy runtime Evidence authority by itself.

The preview preserves the test-only boundary. Runtime Evidence must be produced without production source edits. If
production source edits appear necessary, the report should identify the stop condition rather than silently expanding
scope.

Updated third-fixture gap status:

- `output-requirement-for-test-evidence`: `output-requirement-for-test-evidence-previewed`

Still unresolved before the compliance-checker bridge preview:

- `compliance-checker-bridge`.

## Third Compliance-Checker Bridge Preview

The third fixture compliance-checker bridge preview is:

```text
examples/valid/todo-app-pbe-run/generated/compliance-checker-bridge.runtime-evidence-only.preview.json
```

Preview status:

- `status: compliance-checker-bridge-previewed`
- `complianceBridgeStatus: preview-only-not-implemented`
- `previewGapSetStatus: runtime-evidence-only-preview-gap-set-complete`
- `currentRuntimeEvidenceStatus: missing`
- `evidenceCheckBindingStatus: preview-only-not-satisfied`
- `supportStatus: not-supported`
- `expectedCandidateStatus: contract-candidate-not-run`
- `approvalStatus: not-approved`
- `equivalenceProven: false`

The bridge explains what a future checker would inspect for the test-only behavior proof fixture. It links the test-only
scope boundary, runtime Evidence authority, evidence/check binding, and output requirement previews into future
violation-check inputs.

Future violation checks may include:

- production source modified during a test-only fixture;
- required runtime Evidence missing;
- candidate check reported without captured command output;
- missing source modification statement;
- missing stop condition statement;
- Evidence claimed satisfied while `currentRuntimeEvidenceStatus` remains `missing`;
- candidate check treated as an enforced required check;
- output report missing required Evidence references.

This is still descriptive, not executable. No compliance checker is implemented. The preview does not inspect diffs,
detect file modifications, parse command output, reject violations, enforce scope, run checks, or approve runtime
Evidence.

Updated third-fixture gap status:

- `compliance-checker-bridge`: `compliance-checker-bridge-previewed`

Preview gap set status:

```text
runtime-evidence-only-preview-gap-set-complete
```

Remaining preview gaps:

```text
none
```

Remaining support blockers still include unsupported command wiring, missing authoritative runtime Evidence,
unsatisfied evidence/check binding, no implemented compliance checker, no approval, and `equivalenceProven: false`.

Recommended next step from the observation:

```text
close-third-fixture-runtime-evidence-preview-cycle
```

Recommended next scope:

```text
runtime-evidence-only-preview-closeout
```

Reason: the third fixture preview gap set is complete. The next step should close out what was learned without
implementing compliance checking, broadening compiler support, generating a contract candidate, approving the fixture,
or turning reports into user acceptance.

## Third Runtime Evidence-Only Preview Closeout

Closeout decision:

```text
close-third-fixture-runtime-evidence-preview-cycle
```

Scope:

```text
Todo App add-todo runtime evidence-only calibration
```

The third fixture preview cycle is closed as a support-before-observation milestone, not as supported compiler behavior.
The completed preview axes are:

- test-only scope boundary;
- runtime Evidence authority;
- evidence/check binding;
- output requirement for test Evidence;
- compliance-checker bridge.

These previews show how a test-only behavior proof fixture can separate allowed test/Evidence work from forbidden
production source edits, how runtime Evidence should be made observable, how candidate checks map to expected Evidence,
what output must report, and what a future checker would inspect. They remain preview-only and non-enforcing.

What remains unsupported:

- the third fixture is not supported;
- the third fixture is not wired into the supported compiler command path;
- no contract candidate is generated;
- no promotion review approval exists;
- `equivalenceProven` remains `false`;
- runtime Evidence is still missing;
- evidence/check binding remains `preview-only-not-satisfied`;
- no compliance checker is implemented;
- production source edits remain forbidden or stop-required for this fixture.

Remaining limitations:

- runtime Evidence authority is defined but not satisfied;
- candidate checks do not become required checks;
- output requirements are preview-only and do not generate final reports;
- the compliance-checker bridge is descriptive, not executable;
- no diff inspection, file modification detection, command output parsing, or violation reporting exists yet.

Closed preview gaps:

```text
test-only-allowed-scope
production-source-forbidden-scope
runtime-evidence-authority
evidence-check-binding
output-requirement-for-test-evidence
stop-condition-when-source-edits-needed
compliance-checker-bridge
```

Unresolved support blockers:

```text
not-supported
not-eligible-current-command-not-wired
contract-candidate-not-run
runtime-evidence-missing
evidence-check-binding-not-satisfied
compliance-checker-not-implemented
approvalStatus-not-approved
equivalenceProven-false
```

Future implementation candidates include test-only allowed-scope policy, runtime Evidence capture authority, supported
evidence/check binding, proof-only output generation, and non-enforcing compliance-checker reporting. None of those are
approved by this closeout.

Recommended next step:

```text
cross-fixture-calibration-synthesis
```

Reason: three fixtures now cover distinct shapes: local `bug_fix`, external `behavior-change`, and test-only behavior
proof. A cross-fixture synthesis should summarize what these calibration cycles taught before any preview concept is
promoted into general compiler logic, report generation, or compliance-checker implementation.

## Cross-Fixture Calibration Synthesis

Synthesis decision:

```text
cross-fixture-calibration-synthesis
```

The compiler calibration set now covers three distinct fixture shapes:

```text
local bug_fix
external behavior-change
test-only behavior proof
```

This synthesis is documentation-only. It does not implement support, wire calibration fixtures into the supported
compiler command path, generate new contract candidates, approve promotion, or prove equivalence.

### Fixture Shape Summary

Todo Search whitespace-normalization `bug_fix`:

- proved: the current dry-run fixture can be reconstructed from source authority for major contract fields;
- did not prove: arbitrary `changeType` support, broad fixture support, execution readiness, or universal equivalence;
- stressed: source-authority preservation, semantic diff classification, review-only diff policy, promotion review
  packet, and current-fixture human decision scope;
- current status: completed current fixture, `equivalenceCandidate: true`, `equivalenceProven: false`, scoped human
  decision recorded, generated approval status not promoted.

`component/escape-html` Symbol stringification `behavior-change`:

- proved: DevView can observe a behavior-change calibration input and identify support-before-implementation preview
  axes;
- did not prove: behavior-change support, authoritative external checkout, candidate generation, promotion readiness, or
  graph-delta application;
- stressed: external required-check binding, external checkout path authority, anchor-level context, behavior-change
  risk vocabulary, and graph-delta review binding;
- current status: v0.3 preview gap set complete, still `not-supported`, `contract-candidate-not-run`, `not-approved`,
  and `equivalenceProven: false`.

Todo App add-todo runtime Evidence-only calibration:

- proved: DevView can model a test-only behavior proof where production source edits are forbidden or stop-required;
- did not prove: runtime Evidence satisfaction, supported evidence/check binding, implemented compliance checking,
  candidate generation, or Todo App promotion beyond `structure-only`;
- stressed: test-only allowed scope, production-source forbidden scope, runtime Evidence authority, proof-only output
  requirements, and compliance-checker bridge;
- current status: runtime Evidence-only preview gap set complete, still `not-supported`,
  `contract-candidate-not-run`, `not-approved`, and `equivalenceProven: false`; runtime Evidence remains missing and
  evidence/check binding remains `preview-only-not-satisfied`.

### Reusable Compiler Concepts

The following concepts appear reusable across more than one fixture:

- source-authority preservation: generated contract fields should be derived from input model authority, not copied from
  hand-written comparison fixtures;
- scope boundary: allowed, forbidden, and stop-required surfaces must stay explicit before candidate generation;
- forbidden scope: production source, promotion, acceptance, and enforcement boundaries need first-class representation;
- Evidence authority: observable Evidence must be distinguished from natural-language claims and context-only artifacts;
- evidence/check binding: checks must map to Evidence without becoming required checks unless separately approved;
- output requirement binding: output obligations should report Evidence status, boundary status, and missing proof
  honestly;
- stop conditions: unsupported or out-of-scope work should stop/report instead of silently widening scope;
- risk vocabulary: risk terms are useful review metadata but not mitigation proof;
- graph-delta review binding: behavior deltas can be described for review without applying graph deltas;
- compliance-checker bridge: future checking should compare actual work and reported Evidence against contract
  boundaries, but the bridge itself is not an implemented checker.

Stable concepts are the concepts above as review vocabulary and source-authority modeling targets. They are not yet
stable as generalized compiler logic, report generation, command wiring, enforcement, or execution behavior.

### Fixture-Specific Concepts

`escape-html` behavior-change concepts should remain fixture-specific until another fixture exercises them:

- external checkout path authority;
- external required-check binding;
- approximate anchor-level context;
- graph-delta review-only binding;
- behavior-change risk vocabulary around runtime compatibility, input coercion, Symbol handling, escaping correctness,
  and source-authority boundary.

Todo App runtime Evidence-only concepts should also remain fixture-specific until broader policy exists:

- production source forbidden scope for a test-only proof;
- runtime Evidence authority;
- evidence/check binding that remains unsatisfied when Evidence is missing;
- output requirement for test Evidence and source non-modification reporting;
- compliance-checker bridge for detecting contract-following violations.

Do not generalize fixture-specific concepts by copying their preview artifact shapes directly into compiler output.

### Overfitting Risks

Known overfitting risks:

- treating one fixture's preview artifact shape as universal;
- promoting static preview artifacts directly into compiler execution output;
- treating candidate checks as required checks;
- treating local checkout paths as portable source authority;
- treating risk vocabulary as mitigation proof;
- treating compliance-checker bridge metadata as implemented checker behavior;
- treating review-only closeouts as support, approval, equivalence proof, execution authority, or user acceptance.

### Recommended Next Milestone

Recommended next milestone:

```text
compiler-eligibility-status-model
```

Reason: the calibration cycles now use recurring statuses such as `not-supported`,
`behavior-change-calibration-policy-recognized`, `not-eligible-current-command-not-wired`,
`contract-candidate-not-run`, `preview-gap-set-complete`, and `promotion-not-eligible`. Before adding another fixture or
promoting preview concepts into code, DevView should define a formal eligibility/status lifecycle across fixtures.

That lifecycle should clarify the difference between:

- selected fixture;
- calibration draft;
- policy recognized;
- preview gap set complete;
- compile eligible;
- candidate generated;
- promotion review eligible;
- human decision recorded;
- equivalence proven.

This synthesis does not implement that lifecycle model. It only records why the model is the next recommended milestone.

The lifecycle model is now recorded in
[contract-compiler-eligibility-status-model.md](contract-compiler-eligibility-status-model.md). It defines status
categories, canonical meanings, allowed and forbidden transitions, and current fixture mapping without implementing
support or promotion.

The next direction decision is now recorded in
[devview-compliance-checker-mvp-scope.md](devview-compliance-checker-mvp-scope.md). It selects
`scope-compliance-preview` as the first future compliance-checker MVP axis without implementing checker behavior,
enforcing scope, rejecting diffs, approving fixtures, or changing equivalence status.

## Scope Compliance Checker MVP Preview

The first scope compliance checker preview artifact is:

```text
examples/valid/todo-app-pbe-run/generated/scope-compliance-checker.runtime-evidence-only.preview.json
```

Preview status:

- `status: scope-compliance-checker-previewed`
- `checkerPreviewStatus: preview-only-not-implemented`
- `mvpAxis: scope-compliance-preview`
- `changedFileListSource.status: missing-not-implemented`
- `changedFileListAuthorityPreviewStatus: changed-file-list-authority-previewed`
- `supportStatus: not-supported`
- `expectedCandidateStatus: contract-candidate-not-run`
- `approvalStatus: not-approved`
- `equivalenceProven: false`
- `currentRuntimeEvidenceStatus: missing`
- `evidenceCheckBindingStatus: preview-only-not-satisfied`

The preview binds the Todo App runtime Evidence-only fixture to the first compliance-checker MVP axis. It uses the
test-only scope boundary preview as the source for expected allowed scope and forbidden scope, then records future
checker inputs such as an actual changed-file list, diff summary, agent output report, and source non-modification
Evidence.

Future conceptual violation categories include:

- `allowed-scope-violation`;
- `forbidden-scope-violation`;
- `production-source-modified-in-test-only-fixture`;
- `missing-changed-file-list`;
- `scope-status-overclaim`.

The preview is still descriptive, not executable. No compliance checker is implemented. No actual diff is inspected, no
changed files are collected, no scope is enforced, and no result can be rejected from this artifact. Runtime Evidence
remains missing and evidence/check binding remains unsatisfied.

The third-fixture observation now links this preview with:

```text
scopeCompliancePreviewStatus: scope-compliance-checker-previewed
```

The implementation readiness criteria are now recorded in
[scope-compliance-checker-implementation-readiness.md](scope-compliance-checker-implementation-readiness.md). They define
the future changed-file input authority question, allowed/forbidden scope sources, missing-input reporting, path
normalization questions, non-enforcing result states, and the first proposed static result artifact without implementing
checker behavior.

## Scope Compliance Result Preview

The first static scope compliance result-shape preview artifact is:

```text
examples/valid/todo-app-pbe-run/generated/scope-compliance-result.runtime-evidence-only.preview.json
```

Preview status:

- `status: scope-compliance-input-missing-previewed`
- `scopeComplianceResultStatus: scope-compliance-input-missing`
- `changedFileListStatus: missing-or-not-authoritative`
- `changedFileListAuthorityStatus: missing-or-not-authoritative`
- `enforcementStatus: non-enforcing-preview`
- `checkerRun: false`
- `actualDiffInspected: false`
- `changedFilesCollected: false`
- `scopeEnforced: false`

The preview result intentionally does not report `scope-compliance-no-violation-observed`. It also does not report an
actual violation. Because no authoritative changed-file list exists, the only honest result shape is input missing /
not authoritative.

The third-fixture observation now links this preview with:

```text
scopeComplianceResultPreviewStatus: scope-compliance-input-missing-previewed
```

Runtime Evidence remains missing, evidence/check binding remains `preview-only-not-satisfied`, the fixture remains
`not-supported`, and no checker has run.

## Changed-File List Authority Preview

The first changed-file list authority preview artifact is:

```text
examples/valid/todo-app-pbe-run/generated/changed-file-list-authority.runtime-evidence-only.preview.json
```

Preview status:

- `status: changed-file-list-authority-previewed`
- `changedFileListAuthorityStatus: changed-file-list-authority-unresolved`
- `currentChangedFileListStatus: changed-file-list-missing`
- `actualDiffInspected: false`
- `changedFilesCollected: false`
- `checkerRun: false`

The preview compares candidate future changed-file sources without collecting changed files. It records that
agent-reported changed files are claim-only and not authoritative by themselves. Fixture-provided changed-file lists may
be used first for a static preview result-shape test, but they remain preview-only and non-enforcing. A git-derived
changed-file list is a later authoritative candidate after base/head selection, working-tree state, and path
normalization rules exist.

The third-fixture observation now links this preview with:

```text
changedFileListAuthorityPreviewStatus: changed-file-list-authority-previewed
```

The scope compliance result preview still reports `scope-compliance-input-missing`, keeps `evaluatedViolations: []`, and
does not claim a clean result or an actual violation.

## Authoritative Changed-File Input Boundary Decision

The scope compliance MVP now records the changed-file input boundary decision:

```text
authoritativeChangedFileInputBoundaryDecisionStatus: authoritative-changed-file-input-boundary-decided
```

Decision:

- agent-reported changed files are not authoritative;
- fixture-provided changed files are preview-only and remain limited to static result-shape design;
- review-packet changed files are review context, not the first MVP authority source;
- execution-metadata changed files may become authoritative later if emitted by a trusted executor;
- git-derived changed files are the selected first real authoritative candidate for a later implementation task.

This decision does not implement changed-file collection, run `git diff`, inspect actual diffs, run checker logic,
evaluate fixture-provided scenarios, claim no-violation, claim actual violations, reject diffs, enforce scope, approve
the fixture, satisfy runtime Evidence, or prove equivalence. Until a future authoritative changed-file input exists, the
scope compliance result remains `scope-compliance-input-missing` and the not-run report remains valid.

## Git-Derived Changed-File Input Design Preview

The git-derived changed-file input design preview artifact is:

```text
examples/valid/todo-app-pbe-run/generated/git-derived-changed-file-input-design.runtime-evidence-only.preview.json
```

Preview status:

- `status: git-derived-input-design-previewed`
- `authorityClass: git-diff-derived-authoritative-candidate`
- `checkerRun: false`
- `actualDiffInspected: false`
- `changedFilesCollected: false`
- `evaluatedViolations: []`

The preview designs the future git-derived input shape without collecting files. It prefers explicit base/head refs or a
committed range for the first implementation, defers working-tree, staged, and untracked-file modes, and records path
normalization requirements for repository-root-relative POSIX-style paths. Generated read-model churn should be reported
honestly by collection, with any suppression or exclusion handled by a separate policy.

The third-fixture observation now links this preview with:

```text
gitDerivedChangedFileInputDesignStatus: git-derived-input-design-previewed
```

The result preview still reports `scope-compliance-input-missing`. No `git diff` output is encoded, no actual diff is
inspected, no changed files are collected, no fixture scenario is evaluated, and no clean or violation result is claimed.

## Git-Derived Changed-File Collection Scope Decision

The first git-derived collection implementation scope is now decided:

```text
gitDerivedChangedFileCollectionScopeDecisionStatus: git-derived-collection-scope-decided
```

Decision:

- first slice is collection-only;
- explicit base/head refs are first;
- committed range such as `HEAD~1..HEAD` remains a convenience candidate after explicit-ref handling is defined;
- working-tree, staged, and untracked modes remain deferred;
- collection should produce a collection artifact only;
- collection success does not imply scope compliance;
- scope evaluation, clean result, violation result, rejection, enforcement, CI wiring, approval, and equivalence proof
  remain later tasks.

Future collection-only state may set `changedFilesCollected: true`, but it must keep `checkerRun: false`,
`evaluatedViolations: []`, and `scopeComplianceEvaluationStatus: not-evaluated` until a later evaluation slice exists.

## Fixture-Provided Changed-File List Preview

The first fixture-provided changed-file list preview artifact is:

```text
examples/valid/todo-app-pbe-run/generated/fixture-provided-changed-file-list.runtime-evidence-only.preview.json
```

Preview status:

- `status: fixture-provided-changed-file-list-previewed`
- `inputAuthorityStatus: fixture-provided-preview-only`
- `changedFileListStatus: fixture-provided-preview-input-available`
- `authoritativeChangedFileListStatus: missing-or-not-authoritative`
- `checkerRun: false`
- `actualDiffInspected: false`
- `changedFilesCollected: false`

The artifact provides two static scenarios:

- test/Evidence-only changed files, for a future allowed-scope result-shape candidate;
- production source modified, for a future forbidden-scope result-shape candidate.

Both scenarios are preview inputs only. They are not actual observed diffs, not collected from Git, not agent-reported
changed files, not execution transcript metadata, and not authoritative runtime Evidence. They may help shape future
checker result logic, but they do not prove compliance, do not report a violation, and do not replace later git-derived
changed-file authority.

The third-fixture observation now links this preview with:

```text
fixtureProvidedChangedFileListPreviewStatus: fixture-provided-preview-input-available
```

The scope compliance result preview still keeps `checkerRun: false`, `actualDiffInspected: false`,
`changedFilesCollected: false`, and `evaluatedViolations: []`.

## Scope Compliance Fixture Input Consumption Preview

The first fixture input consumption preview artifact is:

```text
examples/valid/todo-app-pbe-run/generated/scope-compliance-fixture-input-consumption.runtime-evidence-only.preview.json
```

Preview status:

- `status: scope-compliance-fixture-input-present-preview-only`
- `fixtureProvidedInputStatus: fixture-provided-preview-input-available`
- `fixtureProvidedInputAuthorityStatus: fixture-provided-preview-only`
- `checkerRun: false`
- `actualDiffInspected: false`
- `changedFilesCollected: false`
- `evaluatedViolations: []`

This artifact consumes the fixture-provided changed-file list only as static preview input. It records that the
test/Evidence-only and production-source-modified scenarios are present for future result-shape design, but it does not
normalize paths, compare scope, produce a clean result, produce a violation, reject changes, or enforce scope.

The third-fixture observation now links this preview with:

```text
fixtureInputConsumptionPreviewStatus: scope-compliance-fixture-input-present-preview-only
```

The result preview remains non-conclusive: `scopeComplianceResultStatus` is still `scope-compliance-input-missing`,
`checkerRun` is still `false`, and `evaluatedViolations` is still empty.

## Scope Compliance Dry-Run Skeleton Preview

The first scope compliance dry-run skeleton preview artifact is:

```text
examples/valid/todo-app-pbe-run/generated/scope-compliance-dry-run-skeleton.runtime-evidence-only.preview.json
```

Preview status:

- `status: scope-compliance-dry-run-skeleton-previewed`
- `dryRunSkeletonStatus: preview-only-not-executable`
- `resultStatus: scope-compliance-dry-run-not-run`
- `stopReason: authoritative-changed-file-list-missing`
- `checkerRun: false`
- `actualDiffInspected: false`
- `changedFilesCollected: false`
- `evaluatedViolations: []`

The skeleton describes the future dry-run stages: load contract scope, load an authoritative changed-file list, normalize
paths, compare allowed scope, compare forbidden scope, and emit a non-enforcing result. Each stage is currently not run.
The fixture-provided changed-file list is present only as preview input, so it does not unblock evaluation.

The third-fixture observation now links this preview with:

```text
scopeComplianceDryRunSkeletonStatus: preview-only-not-executable
```

The result preview remains conservative: `scopeComplianceResultStatus` is still `scope-compliance-input-missing`,
`checkerRun` is still `false`, and `evaluatedViolations` is still empty. No clean result, actual violation, rejection,
enforcement, approval, runtime Evidence satisfaction, or equivalence proof is claimed.

## Scope Compliance Not-Run Report Preview

The scope compliance not-run report preview artifact is:

```text
examples/valid/todo-app-pbe-run/generated/scope-compliance-not-run-report.runtime-evidence-only.preview.json
```

Preview status:

- `status: scope-compliance-not-run-report-previewed`
- `reportStatus: scope-compliance-not-run-report-previewed`
- `stopReason: authoritative-changed-file-list-missing`
- `nextRequiredInput: authoritative-changed-file-list`
- `checkerRun: false`
- `actualDiffInspected: false`
- `changedFilesCollected: false`
- `evaluatedViolations: []`

This artifact previews how DevView should report a not-run scope compliance dry-run. It explains that fixture-provided
changed-file lists are available only as preview input and cannot replace an authoritative changed-file list. Therefore
no actual diff is inspected, no changed files are collected, no violation categories are evaluated, and no clean or
actual violation result can be claimed.

The third-fixture observation now links this preview with:

```text
scopeComplianceNotRunReportStatus: scope-compliance-not-run-report-previewed
```

The report is explanatory only. It does not implement the checker, run dry-run logic, evaluate fixture scenarios, reject
diffs, enforce scope, wire CI, approve the fixture, satisfy runtime Evidence, or prove equivalence.

## Calibration Success Criteria

A future calibration cycle is successful if:

- the Compiler Input Model can represent the selected `escape-html` fixture without broad `changeType` expansion;
- the compiler candidate either runs or reports a precise unsupported/blocked status;
- semantic diff and source-authority gap reports explain missing coverage instead of masking it;
- no executor automation is introduced;
- no graph delta apply is automated;
- no CI enforcement, required checks, or branch protection is introduced;
- no user acceptance is automated;
- no current-fixture human decision is generalized to this fixture.

## Non-Goals

This selection does not:

- implement compiler support for `escape-html`;
- mark the selected fixture as supported;
- approve arbitrary `changeType` support;
- set `equivalenceProven: true`;
- approve promotion for a second fixture;
- execute AI or apply code changes;
- apply graph deltas;
- introduce required checks, branch protection, or CI enforcement;
- automate user acceptance;
- retire tree-native artifacts;
- rename `pbe`, `.pbe`, validation scripts, generated artifact paths, or sourceMode values.

## Next Step

The next task may decide a collection-only implementation scope for git-derived changed files. It should not evaluate
scope compliance, report no-violation, report actual violations, broaden compiler support, wire additional fixtures into
the supported command path, create promotion review packets, approve fixtures, claim runtime Evidence is satisfied,
implement compliance checking beyond collection, inspect or reject diffs for enforcement, turn candidate checks into
required checks, apply graph deltas, turn test Evidence into user acceptance, allow production source edits, enforce CI,
or change the existing Todo App structure-only status.

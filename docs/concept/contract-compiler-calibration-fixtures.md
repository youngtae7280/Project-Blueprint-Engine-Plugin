# Contract Compiler Calibration Fixtures

Status: planning / non-enforcing / second-fixture selection only

## Purpose

This note selects the second calibration fixture for DevView Contract Compiler Dry-Run generalization.

The current Todo Search whitespace-normalization `bug_fix` fixture proves that one bounded fixture can move through:

```text
Compiler Input Model
-> deterministic contract candidate
-> Contract Fixture Validator
-> semantic diff classification
-> source-authority reconstruction
-> promotion review packet
-> current-fixture human decision record
```

That does not prove the compiler generalizes. The next milestone should observe a second fixture with a different shape
before adding broad compiler support.

## Current Baseline

The current baseline remains the Todo Search whitespace-normalization `bug_fix` dry-run fixture:

- input: `examples/read-model-aggregate/generated/compiler-input-model-dry-run.json`
- generated candidate: `examples/read-model-aggregate/generated/execution-contract-dry-run.generated.json`
- comparison fixture: `examples/read-model-aggregate/generated/execution-contract-dry-run.json`
- semantic diff: `examples/read-model-aggregate/generated/execution-contract-dry-run.diff.json`
- promotion review packet:
  `examples/read-model-aggregate/generated/contract-compiler-promotion-review.preview.json`
- human decision record:
  `docs/concept/contract-compiler-promotion-decision-current-fixture.md`

Current baseline status:

- `equivalenceCandidate: true`
- `equivalenceProven: false`
- generated `approvalStatus` remains not approved
- human decision scope is current fixture, current generated candidate, and current promotion review packet only

| Todo Search whitespace-normalization `bug_fix`                             | Baseline fixture with complete source-authority reconstruction.                                                          | Not selected because it is the baseline.                                                                       |

| `examples/retrofit/cardprinterconfig`                                      | Realistic retrofit records with UI/hardware-adjacent scope and local validation records.                                 | Deferred because it is larger, hardware-adjacent, and less suitable as the first compiler calibration fixture. |
| `examples/retrofit/open-source/kubernetes-sidecar-kep`                     | Large external design-doc retrofit with formal KEP context.                                                              | Deferred because it is read-only and too broad for the first second-fixture calibration pass.                  |
| `examples/retrofit/open-source/escape-html` plus `outputs/.../escape-html` | Existing external behavior-change dogfood with graph source, instruction pack, graph delta, proposal, and test evidence. | Selected as the second calibration fixture candidate.                                                          |

## Selected Calibration Fixture

Selected fixture:

```text
component/escape-html Symbol stringification behavior-change dogfood
```

Primary paths:

- `docs/concept/real-external-behavior-change-dogfood.md`
- `examples/retrofit/open-source/escape-html/graph-source.json`
- `examples/retrofit/open-source/escape-html/records/symbol-stringification.implemented.json`
- `examples/retrofit/open-source/escape-html/generated/compiler-input-model-calibration-draft.json`
- `outputs/retrofit/open-source/escape-html/instruction-packs/symbol-stringification.instruction-pack.json`
- `outputs/retrofit/open-source/escape-html/graph-deltas/symbol-stringification.graph-delta.json`
- `outputs/retrofit/open-source/escape-html/graph-update-proposals/symbol-stringification.graph-update-proposal.json`
- `outputs/retrofit/open-source/escape-html/dogfood-report.json`

Why this fixture is different:

- It is an external retrofit dogfood, not an internal Todo Search adoption fixture.
- It records a real code/test behavior change in a local external checkout.
- It recovers intent from README, source, tests, and graph edges.
- It includes an instruction pack, graph delta, graph update proposal, and dogfood report.
- Its boundaries include no upstream PR, no maintainer approval claim, no package metadata change, and no escaping
  vocabulary change.
- Its Evidence shape is an external project test suite result (`npm test`, 31 passing tests), not the Todo Search runtime
  fixture chain.

## Calibration Input Draft

The first input-model draft is:

```text
examples/retrofit/open-source/escape-html/generated/compiler-input-model-calibration-draft.json
```

The first static observation report is:

```text
examples/retrofit/open-source/escape-html/generated/compiler-input-calibration-observation.preview.json
```

The first behavior-change calibration policy preview is:

```text
examples/retrofit/open-source/escape-html/generated/behavior-change-calibration-policy.preview.json
```

The first external required-check binding preview is:

```text
examples/retrofit/open-source/escape-html/generated/external-required-check-binding.preview.json
```

The first external checkout path authority preview is:

```text
examples/retrofit/open-source/escape-html/generated/external-checkout-path-authority.preview.json
```

The first anchor-level context preview is:

```text
examples/retrofit/open-source/escape-html/generated/anchor-level-context.preview.json
```

The first risk vocabulary preview is:

```text
examples/retrofit/open-source/escape-html/generated/risk-vocabulary.preview.json
```

This draft is `calibration-draft`, `not-supported`, `not-approved`, and `equivalenceProven: false`. It is not wired into
`graph read-model compile-contract --dry-run`, does not create a promotion review packet for the second fixture, and is
not an execution source.

Inputs that can be represented with the current shape:

- `humanRequest` from the external behavior-change dogfood record;
- `graphSnapshot.artifacts[]` for graph source, change record, instruction pack, graph delta, graph update proposal, and
  dogfood report;
- `targetScopeCandidates[]` for `index.js`, `test/index.js`, and review Evidence artifacts;
- `policySnapshot.forbiddenScopeRules[]` for escaping vocabulary, package metadata, upstream approval, and graph-delta
  apply boundaries;
- `evidenceIndex.entries[]` for `npm test`, dogfood report, graph delta, and graph update proposal artifacts;
- `outputRequirementSources[]` for changed files, command Evidence status, validation summary, and non-upstream boundary
  reporting;
- `stopConditionSources[]` for missing external checkout/tests, scope expansion, and unsupported current compiler check
  bindings;
- `riskSources[]` for scope drift and source-authority loss.

Known draft gaps:

- The current compiler input command surface still reads only the Todo Search dry-run fixture.
- External project check IDs such as `check-escape-html-npm-test` are previewed as calibration-only bindings but are
  not in the current required-check registry.
- `work/external/escape-html` paths are previewed as calibration-local source context, not portable compiler support
  authority.
- Anchor-level code/test context is previewed from static record anchors, not supported compiler context.
- Behavior-change risk vocabulary is previewed, but it does not prove mitigation or support.
- The source dogfood is behavior-change shaped and is now recognized as calibration-only policy while still using the
  current `bug_fix` vocabulary; this does not add arbitrary `changeType` support.
- Graph delta and graph update proposal artifacts are review Evidence, not graph apply authority.

Expected resolver behavior:

- Existing output requirement, forbidden scope, stop condition, Evidence, context, risk, and allowed-scope resolver
  concepts should be reusable in shape.
- External checkout path handling and external required-check binding are expected to block or require a calibration
  extension.
- If this draft is wired in a future v0.3 task, the correct first result may be `not-supported` or `blocked` with
  precise source-authority gaps, not a successful candidate.

## Calibration Observation

The observation preview classifies the second fixture as:

- `fixtureStatus: calibration-draft`
- `supportStatus: not-supported`
- `behaviorChangeCalibrationPolicyStatus: behavior-change-calibration-policy-recognized`
- `compileEligibility: not-eligible-current-command-not-wired`
- `expectedCandidateStatus: contract-candidate-not-run`
- `promotionEligibility.status: promotion-not-eligible`
- `equivalenceProven: false`

This is the intended current result. Behavior-change shape is now recognized as a calibration policy boundary, but the
observation does not compile a candidate and does not ask the current compiler-supported Todo Search path to accept the
second fixture.

The current source-authority model appears reusable in concept for:

- `outputRequirements`, with graph delta bindings kept review-only;
- `forbiddenScope`, with external-retrofit policy boundaries;
- `stopConditions`, with missing external checkout/check handling;
- `requiredContext`, at artifact level.

The observation reports likely extensions for:

- external required-check registry binding, now previewed but awaiting authoritative checkout modeling;
- external checkout path authority, now previewed as calibration-local and non-portable;
- escaping/stringification and maintainer-approval risk vocabulary, now previewed but not mitigation proof;
- README/source/test anchor-level context, now previewed approximately but not supported;
- graph delta and graph update proposal review-output binding.

Recommended v0.3 direction:

```text
graph-delta-review-binding-scope-decision
```

External required-check binding and external checkout path authority are now previewed as non-enforcing calibration
Evidence, anchor-level context is previewed from static record anchors, and risk vocabulary is previewed as review
metadata. The next step should decide whether graph-delta review binding is the next v0.3 calibration scope. That should
happen before candidate generation, promotion review, behavior-change support, broad pack schema expansion, or any
execution/enforcement work.

## External Required-Check Binding Preview

The external required-check binding preview maps the escape-html draft's proof obligations to observed dogfood Evidence
without turning them into supported compiler required checks:

- `check-escape-html-npm-test` maps to the observed `npm test` result in
  `outputs/retrofit/open-source/escape-html/dogfood-report.json`;
- `check-escape-html-dogfood-validator` maps to the dogfood validator summary in the same report;
- `check-escape-html-graph-delta-review` maps to graph delta review artifacts as review-only Evidence, not graph delta
  apply authority.

The preview status is:

```text
external-required-check-binding-awaiting-authoritative-checkout
```

This means the required-check shape is visible, but the check authority is not established for support. The external
checkout path `work/external/escape-html` is previewed as calibration-local source context, not portable execution or
compiler support authority.

This preview is not:

- a CI job;
- a GitHub required check;
- a branch protection rule;
- a supported compiler check registry entry;
- a promotion approval;
- user acceptance;
- execution authority.

## External Checkout Path Authority Preview

The external checkout path authority preview describes `work/external/escape-html` using static dogfood metadata:

- expected project: `component/escape-html`;
- expected upstream: `https://github.com/component/escape-html`;
- observed checkout path: `work/external/escape-html`;
- observed clone head: `b42947eefa79efff01b3fe988c4c7e7b051ec8d8`;
- observed dirty files: `index.js` and `test/index.js`.

The preview status is:

```text
external-checkout-path-authority-previewed-calibration-local
```

This establishes only that the calibration artifacts consistently describe the same local external checkout. It does
not independently verify repository identity, make the local path portable, prove a clean baseline, or permit command
execution.

The checkout authority preview may be used to explain why external required-check binding is waiting for authoritative
checkout modeling. It must not be used as:

- permission to run external checks;
- permission to modify external files;
- supported compiler source authority;
- CI enforcement;
- branch protection;
- promotion approval;
- graph delta apply authority.

## Anchor-Level Context Preview

The anchor-level context preview describes the specific source and test behavior anchors behind the Symbol
stringification calibration fixture. File-level context is too broad here because the behavior change depends on a
narrow input-coercion point and nearby verification surfaces:

- source coercion before the dogfood: `var str = '' + string`;
- source coercion observed after the dogfood: `var str = String(string)`;
- existing non-string stringification tests such as `when string is undefined`;
- new Symbol assertion Evidence: `escapeHtml(Symbol('escape')) === 'Symbol(escape)'`;
- existing escape-vocabulary guard tests such as `when string contains "&"`.

The preview status is:

```text
anchor-level-context-previewed-approximate
```

This means the available static records identify behavior anchors, but exact line ranges are not verified and the local
external checkout remains non-portable. The anchors are review metadata only.

The anchor-level context preview is not:

- edit permission;
- supported compiler context;
- source checkout authority;
- candidate generation;
- promotion approval;
- execution authority.

## Risk Vocabulary Preview

The risk vocabulary preview names behavior-change-specific risks for the escape-html calibration fixture without
claiming they are mitigated. It uses the approximate anchors and observed Evidence to make risk review more precise than
generic `scope-drift` or `source-authority-loss` labels.

Previewed risk terms include:

- `runtime-compatibility-risk`;
- `input-coercion-behavior-risk`;
- `symbol-handling-regression-risk`;
- `escaping-correctness-risk`;
- `non-string-input-behavior-drift`;
- `test-coverage-insufficiency-risk`;
- `source-authority-boundary-risk`.

The preview status is:

```text
risk-vocabulary-previewed
```

This means the vocabulary can inform later graph-delta review and compliance checking. It does not prove risk
mitigation, does not make the fixture supported, and does not approve behavior-change support.

The risk vocabulary preview is not:

- final compiler risk policy;
- mitigation proof;
- promotion approval;
- user acceptance;
- CI enforcement;
- behavior-change support.

## v0.3 Scope Decision

The first v0.3 scope is:

```text
behavior-change pack schema policy
```

This scope is now implemented as calibration-only policy recognition. The second fixture remains `not-supported`,
`not-eligible-current-command-not-wired`, `contract-candidate-not-run`, `not-approved`, and `equivalenceProven: false`.

Why this scope comes first:

- the selected `escape-html` fixture is behavior-change shaped;
- the completed current fixture is `bug_fix` shaped;
- the calibration draft currently keeps `changeType: bug_fix` only as a compatibility assumption;
- before external checks, external paths, risk detail, or graph-delta review bindings can be promoted, DevView needs a
  policy boundary for behavior-change calibration inputs;
- without that policy boundary, later resolver work could accidentally look like arbitrary behavior-change support.

Observed gap comparison:

| Gap                                | Why it matters                                                                                      | Blocks compile eligibility | Blocks source-authority reconstruction | Blocks promotion review | Expected implementation risk | Ordering decision                                     |

| Risk vocabulary                    | Keeps escaping/stringification and maintainer-approval risks visible without ad hoc prose.          | no                         | partial                                | maybe                   | medium                       | after eligibility; before candidate promotion         |
| Graph-delta review binding         | Keeps graph delta/proposal outputs review-only and distinct from graph apply authority.             | no                         | partial                                | maybe                   | medium                       | after eligibility; before any graph-delta integration |

The selected scope is deliberately narrow. It should define how a behavior-change calibration draft is identified,
reported, and held outside support. It should not make `compile-contract --dry-run` compile the second fixture as a
supported candidate.

Implemented output for this first v0.3 scope:

- the calibration observation can distinguish `behavior-change-calibration-policy-recognized` from arbitrary
  `unsupported-change-type-shape`;
- the fixture remains `not-supported`;
- expected candidate status remains `contract-candidate-not-run`;
- unsupported/blocked reasons become clearer;
- external required-check binding, external checkout path authority, anchor-level context, risk vocabulary, and
  graph-delta review binding remain future scopes;
- no promotion review packet is created for the second fixture.

Follow-up output after v0.3 calibration previews:

- `external-required-check-binding.preview.json` records candidate mappings for `npm test`, dogfood validation, and
  graph-delta review Evidence;
- `external-checkout-path-authority.preview.json` records the calibration-local checkout context for
  `work/external/escape-html`;
- `anchor-level-context.preview.json` records approximate source/test behavior anchors for Symbol stringification;
- `risk-vocabulary.preview.json` records behavior-change risk terms and maps them to anchors and Evidence without
  proving mitigation;
- the observation reports `external-required-check-binding-awaiting-authoritative-checkout` and
  `external-checkout-path-authority-previewed-calibration-local`;
- the observation reports `anchor-level-context-previewed-approximate`;
- the observation reports `risk-vocabulary-previewed`;
- the fixture remains `not-supported`, `not-eligible-current-command-not-wired`, `contract-candidate-not-run`,
  `not-approved`, and `equivalenceProven: false`;
- graph-delta review binding remains the next future scope.

Non-goals for the first v0.3 scope:

- no arbitrary behavior-change support;
- no supported external required-check binding or CI/branch-protection enforcement;
- no supported external checkout path authority or execution permission;
- no supported anchor-level context resolver or edit permission;
- no final compiler risk policy or mitigation proof;
- no graph-delta review binding;
- no second fixture support or approval;
- no `equivalenceProven: true`;
- no executor automation, graph delta apply, CI enforcement, required checks, branch protection, user acceptance
  automation, or tree-native retirement.

## What It Should Exercise

The selected fixture should exercise these source-authority surfaces in a later calibration cycle:

- `allowedScope`: external local project files `index.js` and `test/index.js`, derived from instruction-pack and graph
  record boundaries.
- `requiredContext`: README/source/test intent nodes such as `module.escape-html-function`,
  `surface.stringification-tests`, and `surface.special-character-tests`.
- `requiredEvidence`: external project test evidence from `npm test` and the dogfood report.
- `forbiddenScope`: no escaping vocabulary change, no package metadata or dependency change, no README/API wording
  change, no benchmark change, and no upstream PR or maintainer approval claim.
- `stopConditions`: missing external checkout, missing baseline install/test evidence, dirty files outside selected
  scope, missing graph source record, missing test command evidence, or upstream approval claims.
- `knownRisks`: stringification semantics regression, escaping/security regression, upstream compatibility claims,
  package metadata drift, and graph proposal being mistaken for direct graph-source mutation.
- `outputRequirements`: changed-file summary, command-output Evidence status, graph delta/proposal status, and
  non-upstream-approval boundary statement.

## Expected Source-Authority Gaps

This task does not implement the second fixture. The first calibration run should expect gaps such as:

- no committed Compiler Input Model fixture for `escape-html` yet;
- required Evidence/check mapping for external project commands now has a preview-only binding, but still needs checkout
  path authority before support can be considered;
- checkout path authority now has a calibration-local preview, but still needs a separate portable authority policy
  before support can be considered;
- required context now has approximate graph-node-to-source/test/README anchor mapping, but still needs exact line and
  portable source authority before support can be considered;
- known risks now have preview vocabulary, but still need evidence-backed mitigation review before support can be
  considered;
- forbidden scope and stop condition sources may need external-retrofit boundary vocabulary;
- graph delta and graph update proposal artifacts may need output/reporting bindings distinct from Todo Search.

These gaps should be reported as calibration findings, not hidden as support.

## Expected Semantic Diff Behavior

Before input modeling exists, the compiler should either not run for this fixture or produce a precise blocked/not-run
reason. It should not claim support for the fixture.

After a narrow Compiler Input Model candidate is authored in a future task, the expected behavior is:

- generated candidate production is non-executing;
- Contract Fixture Validator remains the validator boundary;
- semantic diff classification reports meaningful field differences or source-authority gaps;
- source-authority gap preview identifies the next resolver or input-model extension;
- `equivalenceProven` remains `false`;
- promotion review remains non-enforcing and fixture-scoped.

## Calibration Success Criteria

A future calibration cycle is successful if:

- the Compiler Input Model can represent the selected `escape-html` fixture without broad `changeType` expansion;
- the compiler candidate either runs or reports a precise unsupported/blocked status;
- semantic diff and source-authority gap reports explain missing coverage instead of masking it;
- no executor automation is introduced;
- no graph delta apply is automated;
- no CI enforcement, required checks, or branch protection is introduced;
- no user acceptance is automated;
- no current-fixture human decision is generalized to this fixture.

## Non-Goals

This selection does not:

- implement compiler support for `escape-html`;
- mark the selected fixture as supported;
- approve arbitrary `changeType` support;
- set `equivalenceProven: true`;
- approve promotion for a second fixture;
- execute AI or apply code changes;
- apply graph deltas;
- introduce required checks, branch protection, or CI enforcement;
- automate user acceptance;
- retire tree-native artifacts;
- rename `pbe`, `.pbe`, validation scripts, generated artifact paths, or sourceMode values.

## Next Step

The next implementation task should decide whether graph-delta review binding is the next narrow v0.3 calibration scope.
It should not broaden compiler support, wire the second fixture into the supported command path, create a promotion
review packet, approve the fixture, turn previewed external checks into CI enforcement, turn previewed risks into
mitigation proof, or turn the calibration-local checkout path into execution authority.

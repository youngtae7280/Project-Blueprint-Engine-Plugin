# Generated Read-Model Evidence Requirement

Status: generated-read-model-evidence-requirement / prerequisite-selected / implementation-not-started

## Document Purpose

This document defines the generated builder / CLI-backed read-model Evidence required before actual scoped
source-authority pilot execution can be reconsidered for the Todo Search selected slice.

It is a concept-level requirement. It does not implement a builder, CLI command, schema, validator, CI workflow, source
transition, or generated output.

| Decision scope        | Todo Search scoped source-authority pilot prerequisite               |
| Explicit non-approval | implementation                                                       |
| Explicit non-approval | CLI command                                                          |
| Explicit non-approval | validator / CI                                                       |
| Explicit non-approval | source authority change                                              |
| Explicit non-approval | full Graph-source promotion                                          |

The decision requires generated or CLI-backed read-model Evidence before actual scoped source-authority pilot execution
can be approved. It does not authorize implementation of that generator or CLI.

## Requirement Purpose

Manual parity artifacts are useful and accepted for:

- concept review
- review-only dry-run
- bounded preparation-package reasoning
- source/fallback discussion

They are not enough as the default basis for authority-bearing execution because they are manually assembled. A scoped
source-authority pilot needs stronger repeatability, source-input clarity, and conflict visibility before any source
boundary can change.

Generated or CLI-backed read-model Evidence should reduce:

- source-authority confusion
- manual transcription drift
- hidden missing-node or missing-edge gaps
- view membership / tag confusion
- fallback ambiguity between tree-native artifacts and graph candidate output

Generated Evidence is still Evidence. It is not automatic source authority.

## Evidence Requirement Levels

| Level                             | Meaning                                                                                  | Sufficient for                                                                               | Not sufficient for                                                                |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `manual-review-evidence`          | Current manual read-model parity artifacts, View Instance Manifest, and parity check.    | Concept review, dry-run observation, and preparation-package reasoning.                      | Default authority-bearing execution.                                              |
| `generated-read-model-evidence`   | Repeatable generated output from declared source inputs, with source links and warnings. | Reopening scoped source-authority execution approval discussion for Todo Search pilot scope. | Automatic source authority change, full promotion, validator/CI repeatability.    |
| `validator-or-ci-backed-evidence` | Future stronger level where generated output is checked by validator, CI, or both.       | Full promotion/repeatability discussion if later required.                                   | Current immediate requirement unless user later demands this stronger gate first. |

The selected prerequisite for the next scoped pilot discussion is `generated-read-model-evidence`.

## Source Input Expectations

Future generated read-model Evidence must account for these conceptual inputs:

| Source input                                                          | Expected role                                                                      |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Product selected-slice artifact                                       | Source of product meaning, acceptance criteria, and non-scope.                     |
| Project selected-slice artifact                                       | Source of boundary, structure, surface, and ownership anchors.                     |
| Work selected-slice artifact                                          | Source of work responsibility, scope, and touch boundaries.                        |
| Test selected-slice artifact                                          | Source of Check nodes and verification obligations.                                |
| Evidence selected-slice artifact                                      | Source of Evidence nodes, freshness, and exception state.                          |
| Acceptance selected-slice artifact                                    | Source of user-controlled demo-support acceptance state.                           |
| Change / Impact artifacts                                             | Source of PP-001, stale/reopen, invalidation, and affected-node relationships.     |
| Cycle Contract / Node Execution Contract                              | Source of selected/foundation/deferred/out-of-scope/forbidden boundaries.          |
| Runtime fixture Evidence reference                                    | Source of bounded command Evidence for title + note/content search.                |
| Approval Brief / Evidence exception records                           | Source of retained warning and user judgment summaries.                            |
| Compatibility mismatch supplemental evidence                          | Warning input only; not pilot source scope.                                        |
| Existing manual read-model parity artifact and View Instance Manifest | Comparison/reference artifact only; not authoritative source input for generation. |

This requirement does not define parser design, command shape, file format, package structure, or implementation steps.

## Output Evidence Expectations

Future generated read-model Evidence must demonstrate, at concept level:

- Node / Edge / Tag separation.
- allowed `nodeKind`, `edgeType`, and role-tag taxonomy consistency.
- `viewScopedTags` limited to role tags only: `target`, `context`, `candidate`, `guard`, `required`, `stale`,
  `blocked`, `output`.
- view membership separated from tags.
- 7 Core View coverage: Intent, Behavior, Structure, Scope / Execution, Impact, Verification, Evidence / Acceptance.
- confidence separated from freshness/status.
- source reference links back to tree-native artifacts.
- retained warning visibility.
- Check/Evidence separation.
- source authority boundary statement.
- generated timestamp, run id, command identity, or equivalent Evidence metadata.
- deterministic or repeatable enough comparison expectation against the same declared source inputs.

The output should be reviewable. It should not silently modify tree-native artifacts, manual parity artifacts,
Acceptance state, or source authority.

## Parity / Conflict Expectations

Generated output should be comparable against the current manual read-model parity artifact.

Mismatch categories include:

| Category                    | Meaning                                                                     | Possible control response                                                |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| missing node                | Generated output omits a required durable target.                           | Evidence or Impact Control Node candidate.                               |
| missing edge                | Generated output omits a required semantic relationship.                    | Evidence, Impact, or Decision Control Node candidate.                    |
| wrong role tag              | Generated output places an invalid tag or view membership in tag position.  | Evidence Control Node candidate; taxonomy integrity warning.             |
| stale/freshness mismatch    | Generated output conflicts with known Evidence freshness.                   | Evidence or Impact Control Node candidate.                               |
| source reference mismatch   | Generated output points to the wrong source artifact or lacks source links. | Evidence Control Node candidate; possible authority blocker.             |
| warning omission            | Generated output hides retained warnings or Evidence exceptions.            | Evidence or Compatibility Control Node candidate.                        |
| authority-boundary mismatch | Generated output implies graph/source promotion or tree retirement.         | Decision, Compatibility, or Impact Control Node candidate; likely block. |

Mismatch does not auto-fix source artifacts.

Mismatch does not automatically update the manual read-model.

If a mismatch affects source, acceptance, risk, or authority boundary, user judgment is required before scoped execution
can proceed.

## Gate Relationship

### Evidence Gate

Generated read-model Evidence can strengthen the Evidence gate by making Node/Edge/Tag parity and source links
repeatable. It does not replace runtime fixture Evidence, Evidence exceptions, or user judgment.

### Authority Gate

Generated read-model Evidence can support source/fallback clarity. It does not activate graph source authority by
itself.

### Rollback / Fallback Gate

Generated read-model Evidence does not by itself make rollback-ready status true. Rollback/fallback still needs
fallback trigger categories, precedence rules, and user-visible recovery boundaries.

### Compatibility Gate

Generated read-model Evidence must carry compatibility warnings forward. It does not clean up public docs or retire
compatibility views.

### Approval Gate

Generated read-model Evidence may reopen the scoped execution approval discussion. It does not approve execution.
Codex/PBE cannot self-approve source authority change.

## Non-Scope

This requirement does not include:

- builder implementation
- CLI implementation
- validator implementation
- CI implementation
- schema/type model implementation
- source authority change
- Graph-source promotion
- public-doc cleanup
- tree-native artifact retirement
- generated output claimed as already existing
- scoped source-authority pilot execution

## Next User Decision Surface

The user selected the design-first path. The resulting design is recorded in
[cli-backed-read-model-evidence-output-design.md](cli-backed-read-model-evidence-output-design.md).

After that output design, the next decision surface is:

1. `Approve generated read-model builder implementation task`
2. `Refine output design before implementation`
3. `Require validator/CI design first`
4. `Require public-doc cleanup before implementation`
5. `Defer generated builder work`
6. `Reject scoped source-authority pilot path`

The recommended next option from the output design is `Approve generated read-model builder implementation task` if the
user accepts the current concept-level output shape. Stricter users can choose `Require validator/CI design first`.

### Original Requirement Choice Set

After this requirement is recorded, the user must choose one of:

1. `Prepare generated read-model builder implementation task`
2. `Prepare CLI-backed evidence output design first`
3. `Require public-doc cleanup before generated builder work`
4. `Defer generated builder work`
5. `Accept manual-candidate risk and revisit scoped execution approval`
6. `Reject scoped source-authority pilot path`

Original recommended next option:

```text
Prepare CLI-backed evidence output design first
```

Reason:

- The requirement is stable enough to define what Evidence must prove.
- The exact output artifact format, command surface, comparison behavior, and mismatch reporting are still open.
- A design-first step can keep implementation bounded and avoid prematurely creating a generator that encodes the wrong
  source authority assumptions.

That design-first step is now recorded. Any future implementation must still begin from this requirement's
non-promotion and source-boundary constraints.

## Approval Brief Draft

### Intent Understood

PBE is recording that generated builder / CLI-backed read-model Evidence is required before actual scoped
source-authority pilot execution can be reconsidered.

### Result Summary

The requirement separates manual-review Evidence from generated read-model Evidence and future validator/CI-backed
Evidence. It defines source input expectations, output expectations, mismatch categories, gate relationships, and
non-scope boundaries without implementing anything.

| Manual parity usefulness                     | present          | Manual artifacts remain accepted for dry-run and preparation.                             |

| Source authority change                      | not approved     | Generated Evidence, when later created, is not automatic source authority.                |
| Rollback/fallback readiness                  | partial          | Generated Evidence can help but does not close rollback/fallback gate by itself.          |
| Compatibility cleanup                        | deferred warning | Public-doc cleanup remains visible and separate.                                          |

### Remaining Judgment

The user must decide whether to approve implementation, refine the output design, require validator/CI design first,
require cleanup first, defer generated builder work, or reject the scoped pilot path.

### Approval Choice Candidates

- `Approve generated read-model builder implementation task`
- `Refine output design before implementation`
- `Require validator/CI design first`
- `Require public-doc cleanup before implementation`
- `Defer generated builder work`
- `Reject scoped source-authority pilot path`

### State Label

```text
Decision required
```

Reason: the prerequisite is selected, but implementation/design of generated Evidence is not approved or started.

## Final Statement

This requirement document does not implement a generated builder or CLI-backed output.

It does not create generated read-model Evidence.

It does not execute scoped source-authority transition.

It does not change current source authority, retire tree-native artifacts, or declare Graph-source promotion.

# CLI Output

PBE CLI commands use the same issue shape in text output and `--json` output.

The goal is simple:

- People can read failure output without knowing the internal validator layout.
- Codex can consume stable JSON without scraping text.
- A failed gate can show why it failed, which artifact/node is involved, and the likely next command.

## Issue Fields

Each issue keeps its stable `code` and `message`.

Required fields:

- `code`: stable machine-readable issue code.
- `severity`: `error`, `warning`, or `info`.
- `message`: human-readable summary.

Optional fields are included when PBE can infer them without changing validator behavior:

- `file`: related `.pbe` artifact or repository file.
- `nodeId`: related Product, Work, Test, Evidence, Change, Impact, or Acceptance node id.
- `nodeType`: inferred tree/control node type.
- `stage`: stage-specific validator mode, such as `wpd`, `vd`, `execution`, `review`, or `accept`.
- `reason`: concise failure reason.
- `suggestedFix`: concrete repair guidance.
- `nextCommand`: likely PBE command to rerun after the repair.

## JSON Output

Use `--json` for automation and for Codex-to-Codex handoff:

```json
{
  "ok": false,
  "command": "trace check",
  "exitCode": 1,
  "message": "trace check failed.",
  "issues": [
    {
      "validator": "Traceability",
      "code": "PRODUCT_WORK_LINK_MISSING",
      "severity": "error",
      "message": "Selected/foundation Product node PT-1 has no Work Tree coverage.",
      "file": ".pbe/tree/work-tree.json",
      "nodeId": "PT-1",
      "nodeType": "Product",
      "stage": "wpd",
      "reason": "Selected/foundation Product node PT-1 has no Work Tree coverage.",
      "suggestedFix": "Create Work Tree coverage or explicitly defer/out_of_scope the Product node.",
      "nextCommand": "pbe wpd close"
    }
  ]
}
```

Recommended automation commands:

```bash
pbe validate --json
pbe trace check --stage wpd --json
pbe review submit --json
```

## Text Output

Text output is intended for humans reading terminal output:

```text
trace check failed.

Command: trace check
Status: FAIL
Issues: 1 total, 1 error, 0 warning, 0 info

Issues:
- [error] PRODUCT_WORK_LINK_MISSING: Selected/foundation Product node PT-1 has no Work Tree coverage.
  File: .pbe/tree/work-tree.json
  Node: Product PT-1
  Stage: wpd
  Suggested fix: Create Work Tree coverage or explicitly defer/out_of_scope the Product node.
  Next command: pbe wpd close
```

## Repair Guidance

`suggestedFix` describes the artifact or node repair.

`nextCommand` points to the likely PBE command to rerun after the repair. It is guidance only; it does not bypass:

- normal validators
- state transition checks
- user approval gates
- review or acceptance rules

Common examples:

```json
{
  "code": "PRODUCT_WORK_LINK_MISSING",
  "nextCommand": "pbe wpd close"
}
```

```json
{
  "code": "ACCEPTANCE_CLOSURE_MISSING",
  "nextCommand": "pbe accept"
}
```

Codex should prefer `--json` when it needs to inspect exact issue codes, node ids, or stage metadata.

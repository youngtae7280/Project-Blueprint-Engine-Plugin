# CLI Reference

## Overview

The `pbe` CLI is the deterministic transition and validation layer for Project Blueprint Engine. Skills explain the
workflow, but stage closure, state transitions, file guard checks, and acceptance closure should go through CLI
commands.

Use `pbe status` when unsure. Use `pbe validate` for repository self-validation or initialized `.pbe` project
validation.

[PBE Complexity Governance](complexity-governance.md).

`pbe status` can read stored compatibility profile metadata and show workflow-depth guidance. This is guidance only; it
does not create a separate `pbe lite` command or reduced artifact initialization.

## App-First Usage

In the Codex app, most users start with:

```text
@project-blueprint-engine start
```

A one-line task description may be added after `start`, but `Brief:` is not required syntax. If no task is provided,
PBE/Codex should inspect the current repo and ask which task or slice to manage when it cannot infer one.

The underlying `pbe` CLI commands are primarily for Codex internals, manual CLI control, debugging, CI, and advanced
users.

## Graph-First Positioning

PBE's current forward direction is graph-source-backed read-model projection and evidence. The RPD/WPD/VD/ACEP command
surface remains supported because existing skills, examples, validators, and initialized projects still depend on it.

Treat these stage commands as the tree-control compatibility layer:

- `pbe rpd ...`
- `pbe wpd ...`
- `pbe vd ...`
- `pbe acep ...`
- `.pbe/blueprint/*`
- `.pbe/codex-execution-pack/*`

They are still valid for deterministic transitions and compatibility closure, but they are not a reversal of the
graph-first direction. Do not interpret a stage command pass as Graph-source promotion, tree-native retirement, CI
enforcement, or user acceptance.

Run local verification commands sequentially, especially on Windows, because validation commands that rebuild the CLI
can touch `clean-dist` / `dist`.

When the user's request is vague, PBE should draft a Product Tree candidate first, ask only the highest-impact question,
and wait for user confirmation before closing RPD.

Most commands follow this pattern:

- read `.pbe` artifacts
- run the command-specific validator or transition guard
- leave artifacts unchanged on failure
- write only the command-owned artifact or state transition on success
- report `suggestedFix` and `nextCommand` when PBE can infer them

## Common Options

- `--root <path>`: target project root. Defaults to the current directory.
- `--json`: print stable JSON for automation.
- `--brief <text>`: task description for recommendation commands.
- `--profile <full|lite|bypass>`: compatibility workflow-depth hint for init and recommendation commands. PBE has one
  public workflow; these values should not be treated as separate user-facing modes.
- `--stage <stage>`: traceability/evidence stage mode for `pbe trace check`, or context stage for
  `pbe context recommend`.
- `--text <text>`: text to assess for `pbe gate assess`.
- `--transition <transition>`: Human Gate transition context for `pbe gate assess`.
- `--max-chars <number>`: maximum generated bundle length for `pbe context pack`. Defaults to `12000`.
- `--change <id>`: Change node id for Impact, Revision, and Product Patch commands.
- `--product <id>`: Product node id. May be repeated or comma-separated.
- `--work <id>`: Work node id. May be repeated or comma-separated.
- `--test <id>`: Test node id. May be repeated or comma-separated.
- `--evidence <id>`: Evidence node id. May be repeated or comma-separated.
- `--acceptance <id>`: Acceptance branch/node id. May be repeated or comma-separated.
- `--patch <id>`: Product Patch node id for `pbe product patch apply`.
- `--operation <value>`: Product Patch operation, such as `update_acceptance_criteria`.
- `--files <list>`: comma-separated candidate changed/expected files for `pbe profile recommend`.
- `--candidate <file>`: Request IR Candidate JSON file for `pbe graph read-model validate-request-ir` and
  `pbe graph read-model validate-request-ir-graph`.
- `--schema-validation <file>`: schema-only Request IR validation JSON file for
  `pbe graph read-model validate-request-ir-graph`.

## Status And Validation Commands

### `pbe status`

- Purpose: Show current PBE state and the likely next CLI command.
- Typical state before running: Any initialized or uninitialized project.
- What it checks: Lightweight project initialization, `pbe-state.json` parse, known state, open blocking decisions,
  recorded `lastFailure`, active revision consistency.
- What it writes: Nothing.
- Success result: Prints current state, current gate, next step, delivery status, active revision, last transition,
  recommended next command, blocking issue summary, and suggested fix.
- Context guidance: `pbe status` is context-aware. In JSON output, `recommendedContext` suggests which `agent-context/`
  cards to read first and which full docs to load only if needed. This is guidance only; status does not read those
  files or mutate PBE state.
- Common failures: `PBE_NOT_INITIALIZED`, invalid state JSON, unknown state issue in JSON output.
- Next command: Follow `recommendedNextCommand`, or run `pbe validate` for full checks.

### `pbe validate`

- Purpose: Run repository-level validation in the PBE plugin repo, or adoption-safe `.pbe` project validation in an
  external initialized project.
- Typical state before running: Any time a full health check is needed.
- What it checks: Legacy repository validation, v2 tree system validation, state validator, acceptance actor validator,
  Change Tree, Impact Tree, Product Patch Tree, and visual validator when `.pbe` exists.
- Target behavior: In the plugin repository, repo-only validators remain strict. In an initialized non-plugin project,
  repo-only checks such as plugin README layout, skills inventory, templates/schemas inventory, and examples fixtures
  are skipped; project artifacts that exist still validate.
- What it writes: Nothing.
- Success result: Validation passes with zero error issues.
- Common failures: `LEGACY_PBE_VALIDATOR_FAILED`, `V2_TREE_VALIDATOR_FAILED`, `UNKNOWN_STATE`,
  `PRODUCT_PATCH_OPERATION_INVALID`, acceptance/evidence/visual closure issues.
- Next command: Follow issue `nextCommand`; otherwise fix reported artifacts and rerun `pbe validate`.

### `pbe gate <stage>`

- Purpose: Compatibility gate check for a named stage.
- Positioning: `pbe gate` is retained as a compatibility/helper check. The preferred primary workflow is to use
  stage-specific transition commands such as `pbe rpd close`, `pbe wpd close`, `pbe vd close`, `pbe acep ready`,
  `pbe execution start`, `pbe review submit`, and `pbe accept`.
- Typical state before running: Before entering a stage, especially older workflows that still call gate checks.
- What it checks: Stage-specific readiness and transition guard compatibility.
- What it writes: Nothing.
- Success result: Gate check passes.
- Common failures: transition blocked, missing prerequisite artifacts, incomplete upstream stage.
- Next command: Prefer modern transition commands such as `pbe wpd close`, `pbe execution start`, or
  `pbe review submit`.

### `pbe gate assess`

- Purpose: Assess whether an assumption or transition should stop for a Human Gate using clarity score plus hard
  triggers.
- Positioning: This is advisory and read-only. It does not block transitions, change validator policy, create `.pbe`, or
  modify state/artifacts.
- Typical state before running: Any time a Product, Work, Test, Evidence, ACEP, review, product patch, or acceptance
  decision may be ambiguous.
- Options: `--text <text>` is required. `--transition <transition>` defaults to `product-to-work`. `--profile` defaults
  to `lite`.
- Supported transitions: `product-tree`, `product-to-work`, `work-scope`, `work-to-test`, `test-to-evidence`,
  `acep-preflight`, `review-revision`, `product-patch`, and `acceptance`.
- What it checks: deterministic heuristics for `clarityScore`, `ambiguityLevel`, hard triggers, `requiresHumanGate`,
  reasons, and a concise recommended question.
- What it writes: Nothing.
- Acceptance rule: `--transition acceptance` always requires a Human Gate because final acceptance is user-only.
- JSON output: Includes `transition`, `profile`, `inputText`, `clarity`, `hardTriggers`, `requiresHumanGate`, `reasons`,
  `recommendedQuestion`, and `readOnly: true`.

Examples:

```bash
pbe gate assess --text "choices should be displayed" --transition product-to-work --profile lite
pbe gate assess --text "make the UI clean" --transition product-tree --profile lite --json
```

### `pbe profile recommend`

- Purpose: Recommend workflow depth from a task brief and optional expected file list. The command keeps
  `recommendedProfile` for compatibility with existing artifacts and tests.
- Typical state before running: Before `pbe init`, or when deciding whether a small request needs PBE tracking.
- Options: `--brief <text>` is required. `--files <comma-separated paths>` is optional and is treated conservatively.
- What it checks: Deterministic keyword and file-path heuristics. It does not perform semantic product analysis.
- What it writes: Nothing. It does not run `pbe init`.
- Success result: Prints workflow depth, compatibility profile value, confidence, reasons, escalation triggers, notes,
  and a suggested `pbe init --profile ...` command.
- JSON output: Includes `recommendedProfile`, `workflowDepth`, `confidence`, `reasons`, `escalationTriggers`,
  `suggestedInitCommand`, and `notes`.
- Common failures: missing or empty `--brief`.
- Next command: User or Codex confirms the target task, then runs `pbe init --profile <profile> --brief "..."` if PBE
  tracking is desired. App users do not need to choose a public mode.
- Conservative rule: if the brief or files indicate uncertainty, product meaning, UI/UX, CLI/validator/schema/state,
  CI/package, fixture, or broad implementation risk, use full planning depth.

### `pbe context recommend`

- Purpose: Recommend the smallest useful set of skills, `agent-context/` cards, and optional full docs from a brief,
  stage, and profile.
- Typical state before running: Before broad docs scanning, before choosing which PBE skill or reference to load.
- Options: `--brief <text>` and/or `--stage <stage>`. At least one is required. `--profile <full|lite|bypass>` is
  optional.
- Supported context stages: `start`, `rpd`, `wpd`, `vd`, `execution`, `review`, `revision`, `product-patch`, `parallel`,
  and `documentation`. `docs` is an alias for `documentation`.
- Documentation maintenance requests such as `docs/troubleshooting`, install guide, README, `npm.cmd`, PowerShell
  execution policy, or usage docs are routed to the `documentation` context category.
- What it checks: Deterministic keyword and stage mapping only. It does not perform semantic product analysis.
- What it writes: Nothing. It is read-only, does not create `.pbe`, does not run `pbe init`, and does not modify state
  or artifacts.
- Success result: Prints detected stage, profile, recommended skills, cards to read first, full docs to read only if
  needed, docs not to read by default, reasons, and notes.
- JSON output: Includes `detectedStage`, `profile`, `skills`, `readFirst`, `readOnlyIfNeeded`, `doNotReadByDefault`,
  `reasons`, and `notes`.
- Common failures: missing both `--brief` and `--stage`; unsupported context stage.
- Next command: Read the `readFirst` cards first. Load full docs only when a card says they are needed.
- Judgment rule: The command helps route context. It does not replace user judgment, Product Tree confirmation, or stage
  closure gates.

Examples:

```bash
pbe context recommend --brief "검색 기능 검증 설계"
pbe context recommend --stage rpd
pbe context recommend --stage documentation
pbe context recommend --stage docs
pbe context recommend --stage vd --profile lite
pbe context recommend --brief "리뷰했는데 아직도 별로야" --profile full --json
```

Example JSON shape:

```json
{
  "detectedStage": "vd",
  "profile": "lite",
  "skills": ["pbe-vd"],
  "readFirst": ["agent-context/vd.md", "agent-context/evidence.md", "agent-context/lite.md"],
  "readOnlyIfNeeded": ["docs/vd-quality-rubric.md", "docs/evidence-quality-rubric.md", "docs/lite-mode-policy.md"],
  "doNotReadByDefault": ["docs/review-failure-recovery.md", "docs/parallel-safety.md"],
  "reasons": ["brief appears to ask for verification design", "VD work requires Test/Evidence guidance"],
  "notes": [
    "Read readFirst before broad docs scanning.",
    "Load full docs only when the context card says they are needed.",
    "This command is read-only and does not modify PBE state."
  ]
}
```

### `pbe context pack`

- Purpose: Create a compact prompt-ready Markdown bundle from the `readFirst` files recommended by
  `pbe context recommend`.
- Typical state before running: Before broad docs scanning, especially when Codex needs a small context bundle for a
  brief, stage, or profile.
- Options: `--brief <text>` and/or `--stage <stage>`. At least one is required. `--profile <full|lite|bypass>` is
  optional. `--max-chars <number>` limits the generated bundle and defaults to `12000`.
- What it reads: Only recommended `readFirst` files from `agent-context/`, resolved from the plugin root.
- What it does not read: `readOnlyIfNeeded` and `doNotReadByDefault` file contents are not included. They are listed as
  paths only.
- What it writes: Nothing. It is read-only, does not create `.pbe`, does not run `pbe init`, and does not modify state,
  artifacts, source files, or docs.
- Success result: Prints a Markdown context pack with recommendation summary, operating rules, included context,
  read-only-if-needed paths, do-not-read-by-default paths, and warnings.
- Suggested gate assessment: When a brief is available, context pack also suggests a follow-up `pbe gate assess`
  command. This is advisory and read-only; it does not run the assessment automatically or block state transitions.
- JSON output: Includes `recommendation`, `includedFiles`, `suggestedGateAssessment`, `bundle`, `warnings`, and
  `readOnly: true`.
- Missing files: Missing recommended `readFirst` files are reported as warnings instead of failing the command.
- Truncation: If the generated bundle exceeds `--max-chars`, the bundle is truncated and a warning is recorded.

Examples:

```bash
pbe context pack --brief "검색 기능 검증 설계" --profile lite
pbe context pack --stage vd --profile lite --json
pbe context pack --brief "choices should be displayed" --profile lite
pbe gate assess --text "choices should be displayed" --transition product-to-work --profile lite
pbe context pack --brief "docs/known-limits.md 한 줄 수정" --profile lite --max-chars 8000
```

  validation gate and does not replace user acceptance.

Example:

```powershell
node dist/cli/index.js graph execution-contract report --slice examples/adoption/todo-search-slice --json
```

For the practical end-to-end sequence, see [Graph Operation Runbook](graph-operation-runbook.md).

### `pbe graph read-model check-scope`

- Purpose: Run the local advisory scope compliance evaluator for explicit Git refs.
- Typical state before running: After building the CLI, when a local DevView runtime slice needs a fast scope summary.
- Options: `--base <baseRef>` and `--head <headRef>` are required. `--output <file>` may write the full advisory JSON
  artifact. `--markdown <file>` may write a compact advisory runtime report.
- What it checks: Git-derived changed-file names/status, current Todo App runtime Evidence-only scope inputs, and the
  non-enforcing scope evaluator. It does not inspect patch hunks or read full file contents.
- What it writes: Nothing by default. It writes only when `--output` or `--markdown` is supplied.
- Success result: Advisory JSON with `nonEnforcing: true`, `enforcementStatus: not-enforced`, finding counts, and result
  state. Advisory findings do not fail the command.
- Common failures: invalid base/head refs, unreadable calibration draft input, malformed internal scope input.
- Next command: Review the advisory output. Do not treat it as approval, rejection, required-check status, runtime
  Evidence satisfaction, equivalence proof, or graph delta apply.

Example:

```powershell
node dist/cli/index.js graph read-model check-scope `
  --base HEAD~1 `
  --head HEAD `
  --markdown .tmp/devview-scope-runtime-report.md `
  --json
```

### `pbe graph read-model propose-graph-delta`

- Purpose: Generate a proposal-only Graph Delta preview from a graph-delta-compatible source artifact.

  alignment, unresolved mapping, compatible source, and generator scope decision artifacts exist.
- Options: `--source <sourceArtifact>` is required. `--output <file>` may write the proposal-only preview. Without
  `--output`, JSON stdout is the only output.
- What it checks: Required proposal-only boundary fields on the source artifact, including
  `compatibleProposalSchema: pbe-graph-update-proposal-v0`, `proposalOnly: true`, `graphSourceMutated: false`,
  `graphDeltaApplied: false`, `requiresHumanReview: true`, and `approvalStatus: not-approved`.
- What it writes: Nothing by default. It writes only to the explicit `--output` path.
- Success result: JSON with `artifactRole: graph-delta-proposal-only-preview`, `proposalGenerated: true`,
  `proposalOnly: true`, `graphSourceMutated: false`, `graphDeltaApplied: false`, `approvalStatus: not-approved`,
  `nonEnforcing: true`, and `enforcementStatus: not-enforced`.
- Common failures: unreadable source artifact, malformed JSON, unsupported schema id, or unsafe boundary fields.
- Next command: Review the preview and human-review questions. Do not treat it as graph-source, graph delta apply,
  approval, runtime Evidence satisfaction, equivalence proof, enforcement, or user acceptance.

Example:

```powershell
node dist/cli/index.js graph read-model propose-graph-delta `
  --source examples/valid/todo-app-pbe-run/generated/graph-delta-compatible-source.runtime-evidence-only.preview.json `
  --output .tmp/devview-graph-delta-proposal.preview.json `
  --json
```

### `pbe graph read-model review-graph-delta`

- Purpose: Generate a compact Human Review Packet from a proposal-only Graph Delta preview.
- Typical state before running: After `graph read-model propose-graph-delta` has emitted a
  `graph-delta-proposal-only-preview` JSON object, usually to an explicit `.tmp` path.
- Options: `--proposal <proposalPath>` is required. `--markdown <file>` may write the human-readable packet. Without
  `--markdown`, JSON stdout is the only output.
- What it checks: Proposal-only boundary fields, including `proposalOnly: true`, `graphSourceMutated: false`,
  `graphDeltaApplied: false`, `requiresHumanReview: true`, `approvalStatus: not-approved`, `nonEnforcing: true`, and
  `enforcementStatus: not-enforced`.
- What it writes: Nothing by default. It writes Markdown only to the explicit `--markdown` path.
- Success result: JSON with `reviewPacketStatus: review-required`, review counts, candidate-only items,
  `approvalStatus: not-approved`, `graphSourceMutated: false`, `graphDeltaApplied: false`, and
  `humanDecisionRecorded: false`.
- Common failures: unreadable proposal preview, malformed JSON, non-preview proposal role, or unsafe boundary fields.
- Next command: Use the packet as review input only. Do not treat it as approval, human decision record, graph-source
  apply, runtime Evidence satisfaction, equivalence proof, enforcement, or user acceptance.

Example:

```powershell
node dist/cli/index.js graph read-model review-graph-delta `
  --proposal .tmp/devview-graph-delta-proposal.preview.json `
  --markdown .tmp/devview-graph-delta-review-packet.md `
  --json
```

### `pbe graph read-model validate-request-ir`

- Purpose: Validate a Request IR Candidate artifact's schema and candidate-only safety boundaries.
- Typical state before running: After a future natural-language intake path or calibration fixture has produced a
  Request IR Candidate JSON artifact.
- Options: `--candidate <candidatePath>` is required. `--output <file>` may write the schema-only validation result.
  Without `--output`, JSON stdout is the only output.
- What it checks: Required fields, narrow request type enum values, candidate-only boundary fields, authority status,
  confidence policy, ambiguity policy, and the rule that unvalidated candidates cannot drive graph traversal, contract
  generation, or instruction-pack generation.
- What it writes: Nothing by default. It writes only to the explicit `--output` path.
- Success result: JSON with `validationScope: schema-and-boundary-only`,
  `requestIrValidationStatus: schema-valid-graph-validation-not-run`, `graphAuthorityValidationStatus: not-run`,
  `graphTraversalAllowed: false`, `contractGenerationAllowed: false`, and `instructionPackGenerationAllowed: false`.
- Common failures: unreadable candidate artifact, malformed JSON, missing required fields, unsupported schema id, or
  unsafe boundary fields such as `candidateOnly: false` or `graphTraversalAllowed: true`.
- Next command: Proceed only to graph-aware validation. Do not treat a schema-valid candidate as graph traversal
  authority, contract compiler input, instruction-pack input, approval, runtime Evidence satisfaction, equivalence
  proof, or enforcement.

Example:

```powershell
node dist/cli/index.js graph read-model validate-request-ir `
  --candidate examples/valid/todo-app-pbe-run/generated/request-ir-candidate.add-todo-runtime-evidence-only.preview.json `
  --json
```

### `pbe graph read-model validate-request-ir-graph`

- Purpose: Validate a schema-valid Request IR Candidate against graph/read-model authority without running traversal.
- Typical state before running: After `graph read-model validate-request-ir` has produced a schema-only validation
  result.
- Options: `--candidate <candidatePath>` and `--schema-validation <schemaValidationPath>` are required.
  `--output <file>` may write the graph-aware validation result. Without `--output`, JSON stdout is the only output.
- What it checks: schema-only validation prerequisite safety, target record existence, target component resolution,
  request type resolution, change type compatibility, scope intent resolution, required Evidence policy resolvability,
  and risk intent resolution.
- What it writes: Nothing by default. It writes only to the explicit `--output` path.
- Success result: JSON with `validationScope: graph-aware-validation-no-traversal`,
  `graphValidationStatus: graph-aware-valid`, and `graphTraversalAllowed: true` when the calibration target resolves.
  This is future-pass permission only; the same result keeps `graphTraversalExecuted: false`,
  `selectedGraphSliceGenerated: false`, `contractGenerationAllowed: false`, and `instructionPackGenerated: false`.
- Common failures: unreadable candidate or schema-only validation artifact, unsafe schema-only validation prerequisite,
  missing graph authority metadata, unresolved target record/component, or incompatible change type.
- Next command: A later graph traversal pass may be attempted only after graph-aware validation succeeds. Do not treat
  this command as traversal, selected graph slice generation, contract compiler input, instruction-pack generation,
  approval, runtime Evidence satisfaction, equivalence proof, graph-source mutation, or enforcement.

Example:

```powershell
node dist/cli/index.js graph read-model validate-request-ir-graph `
  --candidate examples/valid/todo-app-pbe-run/generated/request-ir-candidate.add-todo-runtime-evidence-only.preview.json `
  --schema-validation examples/valid/todo-app-pbe-run/generated/request-ir-validation.add-todo-runtime-evidence-only.preview.json `
  --json
```

### `pbe graph read-model plan-traversal`

- Purpose: Generate a deterministic Graph Traversal Plan from graph-aware Request IR validation.
- Typical state before running: After `graph read-model validate-request-ir-graph` has produced a
  `request-ir-graph-aware-validation` artifact with `graphValidationStatus: graph-aware-valid` and
  `graphTraversalAllowed: true`.
- Options: `--graph-validation <graphAwareValidationPath>` is required. `--output <file>` may write the generated plan.
  Without `--output`, JSON stdout is the only output.
- What it checks: graph-aware validation role/status, traversal permission, resolved target record, resolved target
  component, compatible change type, resolvable required Evidence policy, readable graph source, readable generated read
  model, start node existence, and start node ambiguity.
- What it writes: Nothing by default. It writes only to the explicit `--output` path.
- Success result: JSON with `artifactRole: graph-traversal-plan`, `graphTraversalPlanGenerated: true`,
  `startNodeResolutionStatus: resolved`, taxonomy-backed node/edge type fields, role/intent fields for planner
  semantics, and `selectedGraphSlicePlanningAllowed: true`.
- Common failures: unreadable graph-aware validation artifact, blocked graph-aware validation, missing graph source,
  missing generated read model, unresolved start node, ambiguous start node, or missing taxonomy vocabulary.
- Next command: A later selected graph slice pass may consume the plan. Do not treat it as graph traversal execution,
  final selected nodes/edges, contract compiler input, instruction-pack generation, approval, runtime Evidence
  satisfaction, equivalence proof, graph-source mutation, or enforcement.

Example:

```powershell
node dist/cli/index.js graph read-model plan-traversal `
  --graph-validation examples/valid/todo-app-pbe-run/generated/request-ir-graph-validation.add-todo-runtime-evidence-only.preview.json `
  --output examples/valid/todo-app-pbe-run/generated/graph-traversal-plan.add-todo-runtime-evidence-only.preview.json `
  --json
```

### `pbe graph read-model select-slice`

- Purpose: Generate a deterministic Selected Graph Slice from a ready Graph Traversal Plan.
- Typical state before running: After `graph read-model plan-traversal` has produced a `graph-traversal-plan` artifact
  with `graphTraversalPlanStatus: ready` and `selectedGraphSlicePlanningAllowed: true`.
- Options: `--traversal-plan <planPath>` is required. `--output <file>` may write the selected slice. Without
  `--output`, JSON stdout is the only output.
- What it checks: traversal plan role/status, selected-slice planning permission, exactly one resolved start node,
  readable graph source, readable generated read model, start node existence, and node/edge vocabulary consistency with
  the generated read-model taxonomy.
- What it writes: Nothing by default. It writes only to the explicit `--output` path.
- Success result: JSON with `artifactRole: selected-graph-slice`, `selectedGraphSliceGenerated: true`,
  `graphTraversalExecuted: true`, selected node/edge arrays, category arrays, and a selection trace.
- Common failures: unreadable traversal plan, blocked traversal plan, missing graph source, missing generated read
  model, missing or ambiguous start node, or traversal-plan vocabulary drift.
- Next command: A later contract compiler input pass may consume this selected slice. Do not treat it as contract
  compiler input, instruction-pack generation, approval, runtime Evidence satisfaction, equivalence proof, graph-source
  mutation, graph delta apply, or enforcement.

Example:

```powershell
node dist/cli/index.js graph read-model select-slice `
  --traversal-plan examples/valid/todo-app-pbe-run/generated/graph-traversal-plan.add-todo-runtime-evidence-only.preview.json `
  --output examples/valid/todo-app-pbe-run/generated/selected-graph-slice.add-todo-runtime-evidence-only.preview.json `
  --json
```

### `pbe graph read-model generate-contract-input`

- Purpose: Generate deterministic Contract Compiler Input from a generated Selected Graph Slice.
- Typical state before running: After `graph read-model select-slice` has produced a `selected-graph-slice` artifact
  with `selectedGraphSliceStatus: generated`, `selectedGraphSliceGenerated: true`, and `graphTraversalExecuted: true`.
- Options: `--selected-slice <selectedSlicePath>` is required. `--output <file>` may write the generated Contract
  Compiler Input. Without `--output`, JSON stdout is the only output.
- What it checks: selected slice role/status, selected slice generation state, traversal execution state, non-generated
  contract/input-pack flags on the source slice, non-empty selected nodes/edges, target/scope nodes, evidence/check
  nodes, no error findings, and source authority trace fields.
- What it writes: Nothing by default. It writes only to the explicit `--output` path.
- Success result: JSON with `artifactRole: contract-compiler-input`, `contractInputGenerated: true`,
  `instructionPackGenerated: false`, compiler-input group fields, mapping trace, and non-execution boundary fields.
  Broad selected-slice context remains in `targetScopeCandidates`; `allowedScope` is narrowed to selected
  check/evidence/report-oriented artifacts and does not authorize runtime-Evidence-only edits to change-tree or
  work-tree context paths. The output reports frontend field-group compatibility only and does not claim backend dry-run
  validation passed.
- Common failures: unreadable selected slice, blocked/incomplete slice, missing evidence nodes, missing selected edges,
  selected slice already claiming contract input or instruction pack generation, or selected slice error findings.
- Next command: A future frontend pass may consume this Contract Compiler Input. Do not treat it as instruction-pack
  generation, Codex execution, approval, runtime Evidence satisfaction, equivalence proof, graph-source mutation, graph
  delta apply, or enforcement.

Example:

```powershell
node dist/cli/index.js graph read-model generate-contract-input `
  --selected-slice examples/valid/todo-app-pbe-run/generated/selected-graph-slice.add-todo-runtime-evidence-only.preview.json `
  --output examples/valid/todo-app-pbe-run/generated/contract-compiler-input.add-todo-runtime-evidence-only.preview.json `
  --json
```

### `pbe graph operation apply-proposal`

- Purpose: Preview or apply a generated graph update proposal to its graph-source.
- Typical state before running: After a graph delta and graph update proposal have been generated from a bounded local
  change.
- Options: `--proposal <file>` is required. Without `--apply`, the command is a dry-run preview. With `--apply`, it
  updates graph-source node/record status fields only. `--output <file>` and `--markdown <file>` may write review
  reports.
- What it checks: proposal shape, graph delta link, graph-source link, source record id alignment, stale current-state
  protection, and non-upstream/non-patch boundaries.
- What it writes: Nothing in preview mode. With `--apply`, writes only the referenced graph-source when there are
  planned graph-source changes.
- Success result: Preview/apply report with changed files, planned graph-source changes, and boundary flags.
- Common failures: stale proposal, missing graph-source node/record, malformed proposal, BOM/JSON read errors, unsafe
  boundary flags.
- Next command: Review the graph-source diff and run the relevant graph-source/read-model validation command.

Examples:

```powershell
node dist/cli/index.js graph operation apply-proposal `
  --proposal outputs/retrofit/open-source/escape-html/graph-update-proposals/symbol-stringification.graph-update-proposal.json `

### `pbe graph operation generate-pack`

- Purpose: Generate a graph instruction pack for one selected graph-source record.
- Typical state before running: After `pbe graph retrofit plan` identifies an implementation-ready record.
- Options: `--graph-source <file>` and `--record <id>` are required. `--output <file>` and `--markdown <file>` may write
  review artifacts.
- What it checks: graph-source shape, selected record reference, record status/active-code-state alignment, related
  node/edge context, allowed files, forbidden flows, and verification state.
- What it writes: Nothing unless `--output` or `--markdown` is provided.
- Success result: instruction pack with user intent, allowed scope, forbidden scope, graph context, verification, and
  execution boundary.
- Common failures: missing record, record status drift, missing record file, malformed graph-source.
- Next command: Use the pack for the bounded local change, then run `pbe graph operation capture-delta`.

Example:

```powershell
node dist/cli/index.js graph operation generate-pack `
  --graph-source examples/retrofit/cardprinterconfig/graph-source.json `
  --record change.laminator-tag-layout `
  --output outputs/retrofit/instruction-packs/laminator-tag-layout.instruction-pack.json `

  `--output <file>` and `--markdown <file>` may write review artifacts.
- What it checks: instruction-pack ownership, target git diff, and dirty files staying inside allowed files.
- What it writes: Nothing unless `--output` or `--markdown` is provided. It never patches the target repo.
- Success result: graph delta with changed files, related graph context, final state, and boundary flags.
- Common failures: target repo missing, dirty file outside allowed scope, instruction-pack graph-source mismatch.
- Next command: Review changed files, then run `pbe graph operation propose-update`.

Example:

```powershell
node dist/cli/index.js graph operation capture-delta `
  --graph-source examples/retrofit/cardprinterconfig/graph-source.json `
  --instruction-pack outputs/retrofit/instruction-packs/laminator-tag-layout.instruction-pack.json `

### `pbe graph operation run-chain`

- Purpose: Run the local PBE operation-chain wrapper without requiring users to know the underlying PowerShell script
  path.
- Typical state before running: After building the CLI, when you want to run or inspect the plugin-local graph operation
  chain.
- Options: `--dry-run` returns the planned wrapped command without running PowerShell. `--chain-command <name>` selects
  a supported wrapper command and defaults to `operation-chain`. `--output <file>` writes the JSON report.
- Supported chain commands: `operation-chain`, `artifact-inventory`, `core-schemas`, `retrofit-smoke`,
  `evaluate-dogfood`.
- What it checks: command allow-list and wrapped script execution result.
- What it writes: Nothing in `--dry-run` mode. Without `--dry-run`, the wrapped script may refresh existing operation
  outputs under `outputs/`, matching the previous script behavior.
- Success result: command plan or execution report with boundary flags.
- Common failures: unsupported chain command, missing PowerShell runtime, wrapped script failure.
- Next command: Review generated outputs, then use `pbe graph operation apply-proposal` for any approved graph update

  reference records, forbidden-flow boundaries, and edgeIntent claim/classification presence.
- What it writes: Nothing unless `--output` or `--markdown` is provided. It never mutates the target repo.
- Success result: retrofit plan with target summary, counts, implementation-ready records, retained references,
  forbidden boundaries, edgeIntent summary, next inputs, and boundary flags.
- Common failures: non-retrofit graph-source, malformed records/nodes/edges, unreadable JSON.
- Next command: Select one implementation-ready record, generate an instruction pack, make the bounded local change,
  then capture graph delta/proposal.

Example:

```powershell
node dist/cli/index.js graph retrofit plan `
  --graph-source examples/retrofit/cardprinterconfig/graph-source.json `
  --json

## Compatibility Closure Workflow

This workflow is the supported tree-control compatibility closure path. It remains useful for initialized `.pbe`
projects and existing skills, but it is not a repo-wide Graph-source promotion path.

```text
pbe status
pbe rpd check
pbe rpd close
pbe ui approve
pbe wpd close
pbe vd close
pbe scope select
pbe acep check
pbe acep ready
pbe execution start
# bounded implementation work
pbe files check
pbe execution complete
pbe review submit
# user reviews result
pbe accept
```

For user feedback or product meaning changes:

```text
pbe change create --summary "..."
pbe impact analyze --change CH-001 --product PT-1
pbe product patch propose --change CH-001 --product PT-1 --operation update_acceptance_criteria --summary "..."
# record explicit user confirmation on PP-001
pbe product patch apply --patch PP-001
pbe revision start --change CH-001
# bounded revision work
pbe revision complete --change CH-001
pbe status
```

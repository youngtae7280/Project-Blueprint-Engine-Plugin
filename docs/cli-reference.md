# CLI Reference

## Overview

The `pbe` CLI is the deterministic transition and validation layer for Project Blueprint Engine. Skills explain the
workflow, but stage closure, state transitions, file guard checks, and acceptance closure should go through CLI
commands.

Use `pbe status` when unsure. Use `pbe validate` for full repository and `.pbe` artifact validation.

See also: [Install PBE locally](install.md) and [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md).

Run local verification commands sequentially, especially on Windows, because validation commands that rebuild the CLI
can touch `clean-dist` / `dist`.

When the user's request is vague, PBE should draft a Product Tree candidate first, ask only the highest-impact question,
and wait for user confirmation before closing RPD.

Most commands follow this pattern:

- read `.pbe` artifacts
- run the command-specific validator or transition guard
- leave artifacts unchanged on failure
- write only the command-owned artifact or state transition on success
- report `suggestedFix` and `nextCommand` when PBE can infer them

## Common Options

- `--root <path>`: target project root. Defaults to the current directory.
- `--json`: print stable JSON for automation.
- `--stage <wpd|vd|execution|review|accept>`: traceability/evidence stage mode.
- `--change <id>`: Change node id for Impact, Revision, and Product Patch commands.
- `--product <id>`: Product node id. May be repeated or comma-separated.
- `--work <id>`: Work node id. May be repeated or comma-separated.
- `--test <id>`: Test node id. May be repeated or comma-separated.
- `--evidence <id>`: Evidence node id. May be repeated or comma-separated.
- `--acceptance <id>`: Acceptance branch/node id. May be repeated or comma-separated.
- `--patch <id>`: Product Patch node id for `pbe product patch apply`.
- `--operation <value>`: Product Patch operation, such as `update_acceptance_criteria`.

## Status And Validation Commands

### `pbe status`

- Purpose: Show current PBE state and the likely next CLI command.

  recommended next command, blocking issue summary, and suggested fix.
- Common failures: `PBE_NOT_INITIALIZED`, invalid state JSON, unknown state issue in JSON output.
- Next command: Follow `recommendedNextCommand`, or run `pbe validate` for full checks.

### `pbe validate`

- Purpose: Run repository-level and `.pbe` validation.
- Typical state before running: Any time a full health check is needed.

# CLI Reference

## Overview

The `pbe` CLI is the deterministic transition and validation layer for Project Blueprint Engine. Skills explain the
workflow, but stage closure, state transitions, file guard checks, and acceptance closure should go through CLI
commands.

Use `pbe status` when unsure. Use `pbe validate` for full repository and `.pbe` artifact validation.

See also: [Install PBE locally](install.md), [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md), and
[PBE Complexity Governance](complexity-governance.md).

For beta readiness and current limits, see [PBE v0.5.0-beta Readiness](beta-readiness.md) and
[Known Limits](known-limits.md).

For beta migration and optional artifact compatibility, see [Migration / Compatibility Policy](migration-policy.md).

For RPD question selection, see [Ambiguity Taxonomy](ambiguity-taxonomy.md).

For verification planning quality, see [VD Quality Rubric](vd-quality-rubric.md).

For evidence reviewability and proof strength, see [Evidence Quality Rubric](evidence-quality-rubric.md).

For parallel execution and validation safety, see [Parallel Safety Policy](parallel-safety.md).

For repeated review rejection and realignment, see [Review Failure Recovery](review-failure-recovery.md).

For Lite profile expectations and escalation rules, see [Lite Mode Policy](lite-mode-policy.md).

`pbe status` is profile-aware: for `lite`, it shows must-keep guards and escalation triggers. This is guidance only; it
does not create a separate `pbe lite` command or reduced artifact initialization.

## App-First Usage

In the Codex app, most users start with:

```text
@project-blueprint-engine start
```

A one-line task description may be added after `start`, but `Brief:` is not required syntax. If no task is provided,
PBE/Codex should inspect the current repo and ask which task or slice to manage when it cannot infer one.

The underlying `pbe` CLI commands are primarily for Codex internals, manual CLI control, debugging, CI, and advanced
users.

Run local verification commands sequentially, especially on Windows, because validation commands that rebuild the CLI
can touch `clean-dist` / `dist`.

When the user's request is vague, PBE should draft a Product Tree candidate first, ask only the highest-impact question,
and wait for user confirmation before closing RPD.

Most commands follow this pattern:

- read `.pbe` artifacts
- run the command-specific validator or transition guard
- leave artifacts unchanged on failure
- write only the command-owned artifact or state transition on success
- report `suggestedFix` and `nextCommand` when PBE can infer them

## Common Options

- `--root <path>`: target project root. Defaults to the current directory.
- `--json`: print stable JSON for automation.
- `--brief <text>`: task description for recommendation commands.
- `--profile <full|lite|bypass>`: execution profile for init and recommendation commands.
- `--stage <stage>`: traceability/evidence stage mode for `pbe trace check`, or context stage for
  `pbe context recommend`.
- `--text <text>`: text to assess for `pbe gate assess`.
- `--transition <transition>`: Human Gate transition context for `pbe gate assess`.
- `--max-chars <number>`: maximum generated bundle length for `pbe context pack`. Defaults to `12000`.
- `--change <id>`: Change node id for Impact, Revision, and Product Patch commands.
- `--product <id>`: Product node id. May be repeated or comma-separated.
- `--work <id>`: Work node id. May be repeated or comma-separated.
- `--test <id>`: Test node id. May be repeated or comma-separated.
- `--evidence <id>`: Evidence node id. May be repeated or comma-separated.
- `--acceptance <id>`: Acceptance branch/node id. May be repeated or comma-separated.
- `--patch <id>`: Product Patch node id for `pbe product patch apply`.
- `--operation <value>`: Product Patch operation, such as `update_acceptance_criteria`.
- `--files <list>`: comma-separated candidate changed/expected files for `pbe profile recommend`.

## Status And Validation Commands

### `pbe status`

- Purpose: Show current PBE state and the likely next CLI command.
- Typical state before running: Any initialized or uninitialized project.
- What it checks: Lightweight project initialization, `pbe-state.json` parse, known state, open blocking decisions,
  recorded `lastFailure`, active revision consistency.
- What it writes: Nothing.
- Success result: Prints current state, current gate, next step, delivery status, active revision, last transition,
  recommended next command, blocking issue summary, and suggested fix.
- Context guidance: `pbe status` is context-aware. In JSON output, `recommendedContext` suggests which `agent-context/`
  cards to read first and which full docs to load only if needed. This is guidance only; status does not read those
  files or mutate PBE state.
- Common failures: `PBE_NOT_INITIALIZED`, invalid state JSON, unknown state issue in JSON output.
- Next command: Follow `recommendedNextCommand`, or run `pbe validate` for full checks.

### `pbe validate`

- Purpose: Run repository-level and `.pbe` validation.
- Typical state before running: Any time a full health check is needed.
- What it checks: Legacy repository validation, v2 tree system validation, state validator, acceptance actor validator,
  Change Tree, Impact Tree, Product Patch Tree, and visual validator when `.pbe` exists.
- What it writes: Nothing.
- Success result: Validation passes with zero error issues.
- Common failures: `LEGACY_PBE_VALIDATOR_FAILED`, `V2_TREE_VALIDATOR_FAILED`, `UNKNOWN_STATE`,
  `PRODUCT_PATCH_OPERATION_INVALID`, acceptance/evidence/visual closure issues.
- Next command: Follow issue `nextCommand`; otherwise fix reported artifacts and rerun `pbe validate`.

### `pbe gate <stage>`

- Purpose: Compatibility gate check for a named stage.
- Positioning: `pbe gate` is retained as a compatibility/helper check. The preferred primary workflow is to use
  stage-specific transition commands such as `pbe rpd close`, `pbe wpd close`, `pbe vd close`, `pbe acep ready`,
  `pbe execution start`, `pbe review submit`, and `pbe accept`.
- Typical state before running: Before entering a stage, especially older workflows that still call gate checks.
- What it checks: Stage-specific readiness and transition guard compatibility.
- What it writes: Nothing.
- Success result: Gate check passes.
- Common failures: transition blocked, missing prerequisite artifacts, incomplete upstream stage.
- Next command: Prefer modern transition commands such as `pbe wpd close`, `pbe execution start`, or
  `pbe review submit`.

### `pbe gate assess`

- Purpose: Assess whether an assumption or transition should stop for a Human Gate using clarity score plus hard
  triggers.
- Positioning: This is advisory and read-only. It does not block transitions, change validator policy, create `.pbe`, or
  modify state/artifacts.
- Typical state before running: Any time a Product, Work, Test, Evidence, ACEP, review, product patch, or acceptance
  decision may be ambiguous.
- Options: `--text <text>` is required. `--transition <transition>` defaults to `product-to-work`. `--profile` defaults
  to `lite`.
- Supported transitions: `product-tree`, `product-to-work`, `work-scope`, `work-to-test`, `test-to-evidence`,
  `acep-preflight`, `review-revision`, `product-patch`, and `acceptance`.
- What it checks: deterministic heuristics for `clarityScore`, `ambiguityLevel`, hard triggers, `requiresHumanGate`,
  reasons, and a concise recommended question.
- What it writes: Nothing.
- Acceptance rule: `--transition acceptance` always requires a Human Gate because final acceptance is user-only.
- JSON output: Includes `transition`, `profile`, `inputText`, `clarity`, `hardTriggers`, `requiresHumanGate`, `reasons`,
  `recommendedQuestion`, and `readOnly: true`.

Examples:

```bash
pbe gate assess --text "choices should be displayed" --transition product-to-work --profile lite
pbe gate assess --text "make the UI clean" --transition product-tree --profile lite --json
```

### `pbe profile recommend`

- Purpose: Recommend `full`, `lite`, or `bypass` from a task brief and optional expected file list.
- Typical state before running: Before `pbe init`, or when deciding whether a small request needs PBE tracking.
- Options: `--brief <text>` is required. `--files <comma-separated paths>` is optional and is treated conservatively.
- What it checks: Deterministic keyword and file-path heuristics. It does not perform semantic product analysis.
- What it writes: Nothing. It does not run `pbe init`.
- Success result: Prints `recommendedProfile`, confidence, reasons, escalation triggers, notes, and a suggested
  `pbe init --profile ...` command.
- JSON output: Includes `recommendedProfile`, `confidence`, `reasons`, `escalationTriggers`, `suggestedInitCommand`, and
  `notes`.
- Common failures: missing or empty `--brief`.
- Next command: User or Codex confirms the recommendation, then runs `pbe init --profile <profile> --brief "..."` if PBE
  tracking is desired.
- Conservative rule: if the brief or files indicate uncertainty, product meaning, UI/UX, CLI/validator/schema/state,
  CI/package, fixture, or broad implementation risk, the recommendation is `full`.

### `pbe context recommend`

- Purpose: Recommend the smallest useful set of skills, `agent-context/` cards, and optional full docs from a brief,
  stage, and profile.
- Typical state before running: Before broad docs scanning, before choosing which PBE skill or reference to load.
- Options: `--brief <text>` and/or `--stage <stage>`. At least one is required. `--profile <full|lite|bypass>` is
  optional.
- Supported context stages: `start`, `rpd`, `wpd`, `vd`, `execution`, `review`, `revision`, `product-patch`, `parallel`,
  and `documentation`. `docs` is an alias for `documentation`.
- Documentation maintenance requests such as `docs/troubleshooting`, install guide, README, `npm.cmd`, PowerShell
  execution policy, or usage docs are routed to the `documentation` context category.
- What it checks: Deterministic keyword and stage mapping only. It does not perform semantic product analysis.
- What it writes: Nothing. It is read-only, does not create `.pbe`, does not run `pbe init`, and does not modify state
  or artifacts.
- Success result: Prints detected stage, profile, recommended skills, cards to read first, full docs to read only if
  needed, docs not to read by default, reasons, and notes.
- JSON output: Includes `detectedStage`, `profile`, `skills`, `readFirst`, `readOnlyIfNeeded`, `doNotReadByDefault`,
  `reasons`, and `notes`.
- Common failures: missing both `--brief` and `--stage`; unsupported context stage.
- Next command: Read the `readFirst` cards first. Load full docs only when a card says they are needed.
- Judgment rule: The command helps route context. It does not replace user judgment, Product Tree confirmation, or stage
  closure gates.

Examples:

```bash
pbe context recommend --brief "검색 기능 검증 설계"
pbe context recommend --stage rpd
pbe context recommend --stage documentation
pbe context recommend --stage docs
pbe context recommend --stage vd --profile lite
pbe context recommend --brief "리뷰했는데 아직도 별로야" --profile full --json
```

Example JSON shape:

```json
{
  "detectedStage": "vd",
  "profile": "lite",
  "skills": ["pbe-vd"],
  "readFirst": ["agent-context/vd.md", "agent-context/evidence.md", "agent-context/lite.md"],
  "readOnlyIfNeeded": ["docs/vd-quality-rubric.md", "docs/evidence-quality-rubric.md", "docs/lite-mode-policy.md"],
  "doNotReadByDefault": ["docs/review-failure-recovery.md", "docs/parallel-safety.md"],
  "reasons": ["brief appears to ask for verification design", "VD work requires Test/Evidence guidance"],
  "notes": [
    "Read readFirst before broad docs scanning.",
    "Load full docs only when the context card says they are needed.",
    "This command is read-only and does not modify PBE state."
  ]
}
```

### `pbe context pack`

- Purpose: Create a compact prompt-ready Markdown bundle from the `readFirst` files recommended by
  `pbe context recommend`.
- Typical state before running: Before broad docs scanning, especially when Codex needs a small context bundle for a
  brief, stage, or profile.
- Options: `--brief <text>` and/or `--stage <stage>`. At least one is required. `--profile <full|lite|bypass>` is
  optional. `--max-chars <number>` limits the generated bundle and defaults to `12000`.
- What it reads: Only recommended `readFirst` files from `agent-context/`, resolved from the plugin root.
- What it does not read: `readOnlyIfNeeded` and `doNotReadByDefault` file contents are not included. They are listed as
  paths only.
- What it writes: Nothing. It is read-only, does not create `.pbe`, does not run `pbe init`, and does not modify state,
  artifacts, source files, or docs.
- Success result: Prints a Markdown context pack with recommendation summary, operating rules, included context,
  read-only-if-needed paths, do-not-read-by-default paths, and warnings.
- Suggested gate assessment: When a brief is available, context pack also suggests a follow-up `pbe gate assess`
  command. This is advisory and read-only; it does not run the assessment automatically or block state transitions.
- JSON output: Includes `recommendation`, `includedFiles`, `suggestedGateAssessment`, `bundle`, `warnings`, and
  `readOnly: true`.
- Missing files: Missing recommended `readFirst` files are reported as warnings instead of failing the command.
- Truncation: If the generated bundle exceeds `--max-chars`, the bundle is truncated and a warning is recorded.

Examples:

```bash
pbe context pack --brief "검색 기능 검증 설계" --profile lite
pbe context pack --stage vd --profile lite --json
pbe context pack --brief "choices should be displayed" --profile lite
pbe gate assess --text "choices should be displayed" --transition product-to-work --profile lite
pbe context pack --brief "docs/known-limits.md 한 줄 수정" --profile lite --max-chars 8000
```

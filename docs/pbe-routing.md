# PBE Routing

PBE routing prevents Codex from treating an active PBE project as an ordinary one-off coding request.

When `.pbe/` exists, Codex should inspect `.pbe/blueprint/pbe-state.json` before implementation work. The Autoflow state
decides whether Codex should continue a deterministic step, stop at a human gate, repair a blocked step, or answer an
ordinary non-state-changing question.

For supported stage transitions, Codex should run the deterministic `pbe` CLI transition command instead of hand-editing
`.pbe/blueprint/pbe-state.json`. The CLI validates artifacts and allowed transitions first, then writes state history
only when the transition is allowed.

## Routing Order

1. If the user asks for usage, explanation, or a conceptual review, answer normally.
2. If `.pbe/` exists and the user asks for code changes, inspect PBE state first.
3. If `currentGate` is active, stop and explain the gate.
4. If `lastFailure` is present and unresolved, stop and explain the failure and repair path.
5. If `nextStep` is deterministic, run that PBE step.
6. If the user explicitly asks for bypass, classify the request as `bypass`, `lite`, or `full`.
7. If no PBE state exists, use `@project-blueprint-engine start` to initialize PBE.

Common transition commands:

```bash
pbe rpd close
pbe ui approve
pbe wpd close
pbe vd close
pbe scope select
pbe dependency audit complete
pbe plan execution complete
pbe coverage audit complete
pbe ux audit complete
pbe acep ready
pbe execution start
pbe execution complete
pbe review submit
pbe accept
```

## Deterministic Steps

```text
rpd
visual_reference_intake
design_system_derive
wpd
ui_surface_inventory
vd
dependency_impact_audit
plan_execution
coverage_audit
ux_audit
generate_acep
run_acep
visual_implementation_audit
```

## Human Gates

```text
ui_ux_confirm
implementation_scope
review_result
```

At a human gate, Codex should not ask the user to memorize internal commands. It should explain why PBE stopped, what
risk exists, what to inspect, and give natural-language reply examples.

## Ordinary AI Answers

PBE routing does not mean every answer needs a status card. Do not use `[PBE 상태 보고]` for ordinary usage help,
conceptual explanations, or reviews that do not report or change workflow state.

Use the state card for:

- PBE stage completion
- human gate arrival
- PBE status requests
- PBE failure reports
- workflow-changing approval, revision, scope, stop, or next-slice actions

# Validator Design

PBE validation is split into small responsibility-focused validators while preserving the historical command:

```text
node scripts/validate-pbe-files.js
npm run validate:pbe
npm run validate
```

## Layers

- `scripts/validate-pbe-files.js`: orchestration entry point and report formatting.
- `scripts/validators/*`: responsibility-focused validators.
- `scripts/validator-utils/*`: shared file, JSON, markdown, and report helpers.
- `scripts/validators/legacy-core.js`: compatibility validator preserved from the previous monolithic implementation.

## Expected Report Shape

The CLI may render pass/fail markers with symbols. The ASCII-safe shape is:

```text
[PBE Validate]

PASS Plugin structure
PASS Skills
PASS Templates
PASS Schemas
PASS PBE layout
PASS Autoflow state
PASS RPD transition guard
PASS WorkGraph
PASS ACEP manifest
PASS Revision
PASS Examples
PASS Compatibility core

Result: PASS
```

Failures should include the validator name, file, error code, message, and a suggested fix.

## Stage-Aware Traceability

`pbe trace check` can run as a general diagnostic, or with a stage mode:

```bash
pbe trace check --stage wpd
pbe trace check --stage vd
pbe trace check --stage execution
pbe trace check --stage review
pbe trace check --stage accept
```

The stage mode decides how much closure is required:

- `wpd`: selected/foundation Product nodes must derive to Work nodes; deferred/out-of-scope Product scope must not leak into Work. Test and Evidence artifacts are not required yet.
- `vd`: WPD closure must hold, selected/foundation Work nodes and required acceptance criteria must be covered by Test nodes, and Test nodes must declare required evidence. Evidence files are not required yet.
- `execution`: VD closure must hold and required Test nodes must have linked Evidence nodes. Evidence file existence remains the responsibility of the Evidence validator.
- `review`: Product -> Work -> Test -> Evidence closure must hold before submitting for review. Acceptance is not required at review submit.
- `accept`: Product -> Work -> Test -> Evidence -> user Acceptance closure must hold. Accepted/done closure requires user acceptance metadata.

## Evidence Freshness

Traceability validation checks whether Product, Work, Test, Evidence, and Acceptance nodes are connected. Evidence validation checks whether linked Evidence is usable as current proof.

Evidence timestamp fields are read in this order:

- `updatedAt`
- `createdAt`
- `recordedAt`
- `timestamp`
- `verifiedAt`

Linked Product, Work, and Test node timestamp fields are read in this order:

- `updatedAt`
- `modifiedAt`
- `lastChangedAt`
- `createdAt`

If Evidence is older than a linked Product, Work, or Test node, it is stale and cannot close review or acceptance. Evidence with `status` of `stale`, `stale_evidence`, `superseded`, `invalidated`, `obsolete`, or `rejected` is not current proof. Evidence with `supersededByEvidenceId` is also treated as superseded.

Stage policy:

- `execution`: requires linked Evidence and file existence; missing Evidence timestamp is a warning for compatibility.
- `review`: requires current Evidence. Missing timestamp, stale Evidence, superseded Evidence, and invalidated Evidence are errors.
- `accept`: applies review strictness and also checks Evidence referenced by accepted Acceptance branches.

Command wiring:

- `pbe execution complete` calls Evidence validation with `stage: "execution"` and `requireVisualAudit: false`.
- `pbe review submit` calls Evidence validation with `stage: "review"`.
- `pbe accept` calls Evidence validation with `stage: "accept"`.

To replace old Evidence, add a new current Evidence node, link it to the required Test and Acceptance closure, and mark the old node with `supersededByEvidenceId` or `status: "superseded"`.

## RPD Transition Guard

`scripts/validators/rpd-transition.js` prevents downstream execution, review, or deliverable-producing work while RPD is incomplete.

It fails when:

- any requirement Root or leaf remains `pending_interview`, `interviewing`, `ready_to_confirm`, `ready_to_decompose`, or `blocked`
- Product Tree root remains `draft`, `proposed`, `needs_human_decision`, or another non-terminal planning state
- an open `gate` or `blocking` decision remains in `decision-queue.json`
- `pbe-state.deliveryStatus` is `implemented`, `verified`, `submitted_for_review`, `revision_verified`, or `accepted` before RPD completion

Use `draft_created_from_assumptions` or `waiting_root_confirmation` when an assumption-based draft exists but Root confirmation is still pending.

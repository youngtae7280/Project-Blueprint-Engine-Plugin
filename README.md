[![PBE CI](https://github.com/youngtae7280/Project-Blueprint-Engine-Plugin/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/youngtae7280/Project-Blueprint-Engine-Plugin/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

# Project Blueprint Engine

Project Blueprint Engine is a Codex Plugin and an evolving tree-based development control system.

It does not provide a GUI, SaaS backend, or separate OpenAI API provider. It runs inside Codex as a set of skills,
stores durable artifacts in `.pbe/`, generates execution contracts, and guides Codex through those contracts until a
human gate or stop condition.

PBE is optimized for safe, reviewable, staged project construction, not for speed.

## The Problem PBE Solves

Ordinary AI coding can jump from a user request straight into code. That is fast, but it can lose the chain between
product intent, implementation scope, tests, evidence, user review, and later revision impact.

PBE turns that chain into a durable Codex development control protocol:

- Requirements become Product Tree nodes.
- Product branches derive Project, Work, and Test nodes.
- Selected work is packaged into Cycle and Node Execution Contracts.
- Validation and evidence attach back to the nodes they prove.
- User feedback becomes Change and Impact nodes before revision work starts.
- Only the user can accept product results.

## 30-Second Summary

Run PBE when a project needs controlled construction rather than a quick edit.

```text
@project-blueprint-engine start
```

PBE then walks the product intent, builds tree artifacts under `.pbe/`, stops for human gates when product judgment is
needed, creates execution contracts for Codex, runs only selected/foundation scope, records evidence, and submits the
result for user review.

## Quick Start

1. Install or update the plugin from your personal Codex marketplace.
2. Open a target project in Codex.
3. Start the workflow:

```text
@project-blueprint-engine start
```

You do not need to memorize every command. At gates, PBE reports the current state and gives natural-language examples
such as:

```text
approve
continue with the recommended scope
defer login settings to the next slice
change the empty-state copy before implementation
what is risky here?
stop
```

## What Gets Created

PBE writes durable project-control artifacts into the target repository:

- `.pbe/tree/*`: Product, Project, Work, and Test trees.
- `.pbe/execution/*`: Cycle selection, contracts, execution history, and node execution contracts.
- `.pbe/control/*`: human decisions, changes, impact analysis, acceptance, and optional parity/completeness ledgers.
- `.pbe/evidence/*`: evidence tree plus logs, screenshots, test results, and review reports.
- `.pbe/blueprint/*`: compatibility views for older RPD/WPD/VD/ACEP artifacts.
- `.pbe/codex-execution-pack/*`: ACEP compatibility package for Codex execution.

## Official `.pbe` Layout

The official v2 layout is tree-native and additive. Public v1 paths are preserved as compatibility views, not removed
aliases.

## Execution Model

PBE has three layers:

- Skill Protocol: Codex skills define how RPD, WPD, VD, ACEP, review, feedback, and revision must behave.
- Persistent Artifacts: `.pbe/` files make decisions, scope, contracts, evidence, and acceptance auditable across chats.
- CLI gate/state transition layer: the deterministic `pbe` CLI runs file-based validators, checks allowed transitions,
  records `stateHistory`, and updates `.pbe/blueprint/pbe-state.json` for supported stage transitions.

This repository is the plugin and protocol definition. It is not a standalone backend service.

## Core Idea

PBE v2 reframes the existing staged workflow around one operating model:

```text
Product Tree -> Project Tree -> Work Tree -> Test Tree
            -> Cycle Tree -> Change Tree -> Impact Tree -> Evidence Tree -> Acceptance Tree
```

Everything executable should be a tree node or a tree-derived view.

- Product Tree: what the product must mean and do for the user.
- Project Tree: module ownership, surfaces, contracts, and responsibility boundaries.
- Work Tree: executable work needed for selected branches.
- Test Tree: verification of Product and Work nodes.
- Cycle Tree: the selected slice for the current implementation cycle.
- Change Tree: development-time discoveries, feedback, and scope changes.
- Impact Tree: affected nodes that become stale, invalidated, or reopened.
- Evidence Tree: tests, screenshots, logs, diffs, and review artifacts attached to nodes.
- Acceptance Tree: user-controlled branch closure.
- Parity/Completeness controls: optional derived ledgers for legacy inventory, surface completion, visual/runtime
  checks, hardware readiness, and repeated verification misses.

During migration, the existing RPD/WPD/VD/ACEP terms remain supported as compatibility names:

```text
RPD  = Product Tree growth
WPD  = Project Tree + Work Tree derivation
VD   = Test Tree derivation
ACEP = Cycle Contract and Node Execution Contract packaging
Revision = Change Tree + Impact Tree + Reopen protocol
```

## Core Invariants

```text
If it is not in the Product Tree, it is not product scope.
If executable Product scope cannot be expressed as acceptance criteria, it is not ready for Work Tree execution.
If it changes product meaning, scope, UX, risk, acceptance, or verification, it must be a Change Node.
If work is not derived from Product/Project nodes, it is not executable work.
If Work/Test/Evidence does not link the relevant acceptance criteria IDs, it does not prove the Product contract.
If a test does not verify Product/Work nodes, it is not sufficient verification.
If evidence does not attach to Test/Product nodes, it does not close the branch.
If visual UI changes lack a Visual Design Contract source or explicit user waiver, they are not executable.
If required visual states lack current screenshot/manual evidence, visual UI work cannot close.
If a change invalidates completed work, affected nodes reopen instead of being silently overwritten.
If a command opens another surface, command mapping does not complete the opened workflow.
If a control, event handler, hardware action, or workflow state was not checked, it must be reported as not checked and may block closure.
```

## What PBE Produces

PBE is not only a task-card generator. It creates a traceable tree-linked execution contract:

- Product Tree / RPD requirement-tree compatibility view
- structured EARS acceptance criteria registry on Product nodes
- Source of Truth Matrix
- PBE Invariants
- Foundation Contract
- Project Tree and Work Tree / WPD WorkGraph compatibility views
- Test Tree / VD verification design compatibility view
- UI/UX confirmation and UI/UX spec
- Visual Design Contract artifacts: visual reference, theme spec, design tokens, component style contract, UI surface
  inventory, visual verification profile, and visual audit
- Cycle Slice / staged execution strategy
- Change Tree and Impact Tree for safe revisions
- parity/completeness ledgers for legacy migration, UI-heavy parity, and hardware-dependent work
- staged parallel execution strategy
- traceability matrix
- evidence requirements
- final coverage check
- result review and bounded revision flow

PBE is not an execution engine that tries to do everything. It is a requirements-based execution control layer for
AI-assisted development: natural language intent is clarified through RPD, Ambiguity Gate, and acceptance criteria
before Codex implementation proceeds.

## Legacy GUI Removal Status

The old React/Vite GUI has been removed from this repository. PBE now keeps only the Codex Plugin workflow, CLI
validators, schemas, templates, skills, and documentation needed for file-backed `.pbe/` control.

Do not restore the legacy GUI, API-provider, or SaaS direction as the basis for new PBE work unless the product
direction is explicitly changed.

## Repository Artifact Layout

The v2 target layout is additive. Existing `.pbe/blueprint/*` files stay as compatibility aliases or human-readable
views while tree-native artifacts are introduced.

    product-tree.json
    project-tree.json
    work-tree.json

```

## Usage

In Codex, start with:

```text
@project-blueprint-engine start
```

After that, deterministic stages continue automatically. PBE stops at human judgment gates and accepts natural-language
responses:

```text
approve
looks good, continue
select scope: implement USB status only
defer Ethernet to the next slice
create the foundation interface first
fix only the failed case and rerun
current status please
stop
```

The old step-by-step commands remain supported for manual control.

## How PBE Runs

PBE is easiest to understand as a stateful Codex workflow:

1. Codex reads the target repository and the existing `.pbe/` folder.
2. PBE stores durable state in `.pbe/blueprint/pbe-state.json`.
3. PBE routing reads that state before implementation or deliverable-producing work.
4. Deterministic stages continue automatically.
5. Human gates stop the flow only when product judgment is required.
6. ACEP/Cycle Contract turns the approved plan into a Codex execution contract.
7. Codex implements only selected and approved foundation scope.
8. The user, not Codex, decides whether the result is accepted.

## Human Gates

PBE stops only where the user has to make a product or delivery decision.

| Gate                 | Why PBE Stops                                                                                                                                                                            | Typical User Replies                                                                            |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Root confirmation    | Even a clear request must be summarized and structurally confirmed before RPD ends.                                                                                                      | `use this structure`, `revise the audience`, `decompose this further`                           |
| UI/UX confirmation   | UI behavior should not be implemented before the user confirms the flow, wording, states, and exceptions.                                                                                | `approve`, `change the failure screen`, `what is risky?`                                        |
| Visual design source | Visual appearance changes need a source of truth before implementation. PBE offers screenshot, reference app/site, existing screen, short interview, default PBE Clean Theme, or waiver. | `use the default PBE Clean Theme`, `use this screenshot`, `waive visual quality for this slice` |
| Implementation scope | The user must decide what is selected now, what is deferred, what is foundation, and what is out of scope.                                                                               | `select the recommended scope`, `defer Ethernet`, `foundation first`                            |
| Architecture runway  | Future or deferred modules may require foundation work now to avoid rework later.                                                                                                        | `approve the foundation`, `interface only`, `skip this foundation`                              |
| Review result        | Codex can submit work for review, but only the user can accept it.                                                                                                                       | `looks good`, `fix the failed case`, `is this safe to finish?`                                  |
| Next slice decision  | A reviewed slice is not the same as whole-project completion.                                                                                                                            | `complete current slice`, `start next slice`, `complete project`                                |

## Visual Design Contract Workflow

PBE separates UX confirmation from visual design confirmation.

`pbe-ui-ux-confirm` approves the product flow, screen purpose, states, labels, and interaction expectations. It does not
by itself approve visual theme, polish, or style consistency.

When selected UI work changes visual appearance, PBE must create a Visual Design Contract before WPD, ACEP, or UI
implementation proceeds. The visual source must be one of:

- reference screenshot
- reference app or website
- existing project screen
- short visual preference interview
- default PBE Clean Theme
- explicit user waiver
- not required, when the work does not affect visual appearance

The visual workflow is:

```text
UI_UX_APPROVED
-> Visual Reference Intake
-> Design System Derive
-> VISUAL_CONTRACT_READY
-> WPD_DONE
-> UI Surface Inventory
-> UI_SURFACE_INVENTORY_DONE
-> VD_DONE
-> ACEP_READY
-> EXECUTION_IN_PROGRESS
-> ACEP_RUN_DONE
-> Visual Implementation Audit
-> VISUAL_AUDIT_DONE
-> WAITING_REVIEW_RESULT
```

Required visual artifacts:

```text
.pbe/blueprint/visual-reference.json
.pbe/blueprint/ui-theme-spec.md
.pbe/blueprint/design-tokens.json
.pbe/blueprint/component-style-contract.json
.pbe/control/ui-surface-inventory.json
.pbe/control/component-style-inventory.json
.pbe/control/visual-verification-profile.json
.pbe/evidence/screenshots/
.pbe/evidence/visual-audit.md
```

Recommended CLI checks:

```bash
pbe visual check
pbe evidence check
pbe acep check
pbe gate review-result
```

Review Result cannot close selected visual UI work when required screenshots are missing, screenshot evidence is stale,
`visual-audit.md` is missing, or the audit contains unresolved blocking issues.

## Artifact Flow

PBE's product interface is the `.pbe/` folder. The files are the contract between user intent, Codex planning,
implementation, verification, and review.

```

## Module Logic

Each PBE module has one job. The workflow is safe because no module silently expands another module's responsibility.

| Module                        | Input                                                             | What It Does                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Output                                                                    | User Involvement                                                           |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pbe-start`                   | User request, target repo, existing `.pbe/`                       | Detects whether PBE is new or continuing, initializes state, chooses an execution profile, and starts RPD unless bypassed.                                                                                                                                                                                 | `pbe-state.json`, project brief, initial blueprint files                  | Usually one `start` request                                                |
| `RPD`                         | User answers, project brief, existing requirement tree            | Walks one requirement node at a time, asks one open-ended question when needed, extracts facts, and proposes confirmation or decomposition. If the request is clear, Codex proposes the Root summary and child structure instead of asking whether to interview more.

## State And Natural Language

Natural language is mapped to internal actions:

## Response Format

When PBE reports workflow state, it separates the official state card from free-form explanation:

```text
[PBE 상태 보고]
...

[Codex 메모]
...
```

`[PBE 상태 보고]` is the authoritative workflow status. It shows the current stage, completed work, artifacts,
validation, why PBE stopped, what happens next, possible user replies, and one recommended reply.

`[Codex 메모]` is optional. It contains explanation, rationale, or risk notes.

Ordinary AI answers that are not reporting PBE workflow state should not use the status card.

## Execution Profiles

```text
bypass
lite
full
```

- `bypass`: typo, single-file edit, or clearly bounded small bug fix.
- `lite`: existing blueprint and small slice with limited risk.
- `full`: project construction, new feature, multi-module work, UI/UX, architecture runway, parallel work, or
  future-module impact. This is the default PBE profile.

## Autoflow

```text
start
-> grow product tree / rpd
-> ui ux confirm gate
-> derive project/work tree / wpd
-> derive test tree / vd
-> dependency impact audit
-> select cycle slice
-> implementation scope gate
-> architecture runway gate, when needed
-> plan execution / generate cycle strategy
-> coverage audit
-> ux audit
-> generate acep / cycle contract
-> run acep / run cycle contract
-> review result gate
-> next slice decision
```

Human gates:

- root confirmation
- UI/UX confirmation
- implementation scope
- architecture runway
- result review
- next slice decision

## State Model

Autoflow state is stored in `.pbe/blueprint/pbe-state.json` under `autoflow`.

PBE routing uses that state before implementation or deliverable-producing work:

- active `currentGate` means Codex must stop and ask for the user's decision
- `INIT` means PBE is initialized or still resolving the Root requirement before RPD can close
- `lastFailure` means Codex must report repair options and must not continue downstream
- deterministic `nextStep` means Codex should run the next PBE step before ordinary coding
- ordinary usage help or conceptual review can be answered without a PBE status card
- `accepted` requires explicit user acceptance metadata; Codex may submit for review, but only the user can set
  acceptance
- parity/completeness controls are optional derived views; they may expand audit and verification coverage, but
  implementation scope still requires Product/Project/Work nodes and normal PBE gates

`DONE` means the user explicitly approved the current branch/slice or project completion. Starting another slice moves
back to `WAITING_IMPLEMENTATION_SCOPE` with a new selected scope.

## CLI Gate And State Transition Layer

PBE is built from three cooperating parts:

- Skill Protocol: human-facing Codex skills for RPD, WPD, VD, ACEP, review, feedback, and revision.
- Persistent `.pbe` Artifacts: durable trees, contracts, evidence, decisions, and compatibility views.
- CLI gate/state transition layer: deterministic file checks and state transitions for rules that can be judged without
  model reasoning.

Codex should not hand-edit `.pbe/blueprint/pbe-state.json` for supported stage transitions. It should generate or update
the required artifacts, run the relevant `pbe` command, and let the CLI update `autoflow.state`,
`autoflow.completedSteps`, gates, `deliveryStatus`, and `autoflow.stateHistory` only after validation passes.

Build the CLI:

```bash
npm run build:cli
```

Core commands:

```bash
npx pbe --help
npx pbe init
npx pbe status
npx pbe validate
npx pbe rpd close
npx pbe ui approve
npx pbe wpd close
npx pbe vd close
npx pbe scope select
npx pbe dependency audit complete
npx pbe plan execution complete
npx pbe coverage audit complete
npx pbe ux audit complete
npx pbe acep ready
npx pbe execution start
npx pbe execution complete
npx pbe review submit
npx pbe accept
```

Use `--json` for stable machine-readable output and exit codes:

```bash
npx pbe validate --json
npx pbe status --json
```

Transition commands validate their inputs before writing state. If validation or the allowed-transition check fails, the
command exits non-zero and leaves `pbe-state.json` unchanged.

The commands `pbe dependency audit complete`, `pbe plan execution complete`, `pbe coverage audit complete`, and
`pbe ux audit complete` are checkpoint commands inside `SCOPE_SELECTED`. They do not create new top-level states. They
record deterministic sub-step completion in `autoflow.completedSteps`, advance `autoflow.nextStep`, and block
`pbe acep ready` until all four checkpoints are complete.

Execution, review, and acceptance use this canonical CLI flow:

```bash
npx pbe acep ready
npx pbe execution start
npx pbe execution complete
npx pbe review submit
npx pbe accept
```

`pbe review submit` is not user approval; it only moves verified work to the Review Result gate. `pbe accept` requires
explicit user acceptance metadata and records both `ACCEPTED` and `DONE` in state history.

## Parallel Safety

WPD creates a WorkGraph. Plan Execution converts that WorkGraph into a staged strategy.

PBE does not use RPD nodes directly as parallel coding tasks.

Validator enforcement rejects parallel groups that reuse the same normalized `expectedFiles` path, mix shared files with
another task's write set, use broad or unknown paths, omit integration tasks, or exceed the safe group size without
human approval.

Parallel tasks require known expected files, low unknown file-touch risk, no forbidden shared changes, and an
integration task. Every parallel group requires integration evidence and cannot complete without an integration pass.

## Acceptance

Codex may report:

```text
implemented
verified
submitted_for_review
revision_requested
revision_in_progress
revision_verified
```

Only the user can mark work or a Product branch as:

```text
accepted
accepted_done
```

If the user is dissatisfied, feedback is mapped to affected requirements, tasks, UI/UX items, and verification items
before a bounded Revision Pack is created.

Revision manifests declare `allowedFiles`, `forbiddenFiles`, and `mustNotTouch`. The validator checks changed, staged,
and untracked files against those boundaries so a narrow revision does not quietly expand into unrelated code.

## Validation

GitHub Actions runs the same quality gate on `push` and `pull_request` to `main`:

```bash
npm run format:check
npm run typecheck
npm run test
npm run validate:pbe
npm run validate:pbe:v2
npm run test:examples
```

Build and use the deterministic PBE CLI:

```bash
npm run build:cli
npx pbe --help
npx pbe status --root /path/to/project
npx pbe validate --root /path/to/project
npx pbe rpd check --root /path/to/project
npx pbe rpd close --root /path/to/project
npx pbe ui approve --root /path/to/project
npx pbe wpd close --root /path/to/project
npx pbe vd close --root /path/to/project
npx pbe dependency audit complete --root /path/to/project
npx pbe plan execution complete --root /path/to/project
npx pbe coverage audit complete --root /path/to/project
npx pbe ux audit complete --root /path/to/project
npx pbe acep ready --root /path/to/project
npx pbe execution start --root /path/to/project
npx pbe execution complete --root /path/to/project
npx pbe review submit --root /path/to/project
npx pbe accept --root /path/to/project
```

Format and check repository style:

```bash
npm run format
npm run format:check
```

The CLI does not replace Codex, call OpenAI APIs, run a daemon, or revive the legacy GUI. It reads and writes `.pbe`
artifacts only. `pbe validate` wraps the preserved validators and adds deterministic stage checks where the rule can be
judged from files.

Validate plugin structure and JSON files:

```bash
npm run validate:pbe
```

This command builds the CLI and runs `pbe validate`. The validation compiles the JSON schemas with AJV, validates `.pbe`
artifacts against those schemas when present, checks cross-artifact traceability, enforces dependency-impact artifacts,
verifies UI impact fields, and rejects unsafe parallel or revision boundaries.

Validate v2 tree-control schemas, templates, and optional `.pbe` tree artifacts:

```bash
npm run validate:pbe:v2
```

This validation is backward compatible. If no `.pbe/tree`, `.pbe/execution`, `.pbe/control`, or `.pbe/evidence`
artifacts exist yet, it validates only the v2 schemas/templates and exits successfully.

Run the example fixture regression suite:

```bash
npm run test:examples
```

This builds the CLI, validates the closed golden run at `examples/valid/todo-app-pbe-run`, and checks invalid fixtures
under `examples/invalid/*` for their expected PBE issue codes. The valid example closes Product -> Work -> Test ->
Evidence -> user Acceptance traceability and includes a Change/Impact skeleton. Invalid examples intentionally break one
closure rule at a time, such as ambiguous acceptance criteria, missing Work/Test links, missing or stale Evidence,
assistant acceptance, deferred scope leakage, or revision without Impact analysis.

Validate the Codex plugin manifest and skills:

```bash
python C:/Users/ytkim/.codex/skills/.system/plugin-creator/scripts/validate_plugin.py .
```

## Removed Legacy GUI

The previous React/Vite GUI implementation and its local browser API-provider experiment were removed. The removed
surface included:

```text
src/
public/
index.html
vite.config.ts
tsconfig.app.json
tsconfig.node.json
docs/legacy-gui/
legacy:* npm scripts
React/Vite runtime dependencies
```

PBE remains a Codex Plugin workflow with CLI validation, not a standalone application.
